    "# Body Electricity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment we are going to investigate the body's electrical signals while exercising and at rest using a [micro:bit](https://www.microbit.org) to collect data, similar to [electrocardiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography). This is adapted from from [“Body Electrical & Waves“](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KofuOt0v1lmQhQyJux1XWDVoCDeslcjDFysjStFmo1w/edit#heading=h.psmccwuvnuvx) by [Carl Lyman](https://sites.google.com/view/utahcodingproject).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have access to a micro:bit, you can skip the **Procedure** section and use the example data provided for your **Observations and Analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "* micro:bit running the [latest firmware](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/firmware)\n",
    "* USB cable\n",
    "* two wires (preferably with alligator clips)\n",

    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "1. Connect the micro:bit to your computer or Chromebook using the USB cable.\n",
    "2. Connect the wires to the micro:bit, one to **GND** and the other to **0**.\n",
    "3. Launch [Microsoft MakeCode with the ECG code](https://makecode.microbit.org/_DXa5vgUJpYzc).\n",
    "4. Click the **↗Edit** button at the top right to open the code editor. If you prefer to program it in Python, the code should be:\n",

    "EKG = 0\n",
    "def on_forever():\n",

    "    serial.write_value(\"ECG\", ECG)\n",
    "basic.forever(on_forever)\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Near the bottom left, click the **`...`** button and select **Pair device**, then follow the directions to pair your micro:bit.\n",
    "6. Once your micro:bit is paired, click the **`...`** button again and select **Download to micro:bit** to send the code to your micro:bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collecting Data\n",
    "7. Click the **Show console Device** button.\n",
    "8. Hold the end of one wire in each hand, making sure that the exposed metal is touching your skin.\n",
    "9. Sit still for about 5 seconds, then run in place for about 10 seconds, then sit still for another 5 seconds.\n",
    "10. Click the pause button at the top right\n",
    "11. Click the download button to download your data as a `csv` file. For more information on this check out the [documentation](https://makecode.microbit.org/device/data-analysis/viewing). You should now have a data file downloaded that is called something like `microbit-data-12-2021-21-32-29-0700.csv`.\n",
