    "# Body Electricity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment we are going to investigate the body's electrical signals while exercising and at rest using a [micro:bit](https://www.microbit.org) to collect data, similar to [electrocardiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography). This is adapted from from [“Body Electrical & Waves“](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KofuOt0v1lmQhQyJux1XWDVoCDeslcjDFysjStFmo1w) by [Carl Lyman](https://sites.google.com/view/utahcodingproject).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have access to a micro:bit, you can skip the **Procedure** section and use the example data provided for your **Observations and Analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "* micro:bit running the [latest firmware](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/firmware)\n",
    "* USB cable\n",
    "* two wires (preferably with alligator clips)\n",
    "* tape (preferably skin tape or painter's tape)\n",
    "\n",
    "![micro:bit with wires](./images/microbit-with-wires.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "1. Connect the micro:bit to your computer or Chromebook using the USB cable.\n",
    "2. Connect the wires to the micro:bit, one to **GND** and the other to **0**.\n",
    "3. Launch [Microsoft MakeCode with the ECG code](https://makecode.microbit.org/_DXa5vgUJpYzc).\n",
    "\n",
    "![MakeCode ECG](./images/makecode-ecg.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Click the **↗Edit** button at the top right to open the code editor. If you prefer to program it in Python, the code should be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "EKG = 0\n",
    "def on_forever():\n",

    "basic.forever(on_forever)\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Near the bottom left, click the **`...`** button and select **Pair device**, then follow the directions to pair your micro:bit.\n",
    "6. Once your micro:bit is paired, click the **`...`** button again and select **Download to micro:bit** to send the code to your micro:bit.\n",
    "\n",

    "![MakeCode show console](./images/makecode-show-console.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Tape the ends of the wire to the underside of your forearm, about 15 cm apart. Make sure that the exposed metal is touching your skin, you may need to hold them in place if the tape doesn't maintain contact between the metal and your skin.\n",
    "9. Sit still for about 5 seconds, then run in place for about 10 seconds, then sit still for another 5 seconds.\n",
    "10. Click the pause button at the top right.\n",
    "\n",
    "![MakeCode pause and download](./images/makecode-pause-download.jpg)\n",
