    "In this notebook, we introduced two important concepts of motion: Uniform and Uniformly accelerated motion. We demonstrated how motion is related to distance, speed, velocity and acceleration. We also showed the various linear relationships between displacement, velocity and uniform acceleration using both the equations of motion, and the graphs of those functions. Using these equations, we then demonstrated several cases where they we can apply the ideas of uniform motion and uniformly accelerated motion to solve classic physics problems. This notebook serves as an introduction to the concept of uniform and uniformly accelerated motion, and will allow you to solve a great many problems using these concepts, and should act as a reasonable primer for more complex kinematic problems."
