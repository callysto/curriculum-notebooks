    "The Earth's climate has been subject to changes throughout history and most of these can be attributed to variations in Earth's orbit resulting in the amount of solar energy that is received. The reason behind significant increase in warming trend since the industrial revolution is extremely likely to be the result of human activity.\n",

    "Earth is a complex integrated system of components and processes. A disturbance in one component can have unprecedented and irreversible effects over another component.\n",

    "\n",
    "Earth-orbiting satellites and other scientific advancements have made it possible to understand Earth on a global scale and have enabled scientists to collect many different types of information about our planet, its climate and use it to analyze how it has changed over the years. \n",

    "It is important to understand the evidence available for global climate change and the potential impacts it can cause in order to address the challenges that we may face. Knowing how these Earth systems have changed in the past and how they are changing in response to climate change now will help us understand how they will likely change in the future.\n",
