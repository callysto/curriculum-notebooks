    "Climate change is a frequently discussed topic. [This TED-Ed video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCPTbfQyMt8) talks about weather becoming more extreme because of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at the extent of climate change by examining data such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* duration and thickness of sea ice\n",
    "* ocean levels\n",
    "* frequency of forest fires\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebok we will explore data on each of these indicators. At the end you will be asked to reflect on some questions to determine what you have learned based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We retrieved data from the NASA [Global Climate Change-Vital Signs of the Planet](https://climate.nasa.gov/) website. This website has many other interesting details on it including other visualizations, facts, and information on how to mitigate climate change. On this website you can read about why climate change is happening, learn more about what is causing climate change and discover the effects the world is already seeing from climate change. The website also provides a chance to read about those that are working to help the world cope with climate change and slow the process down. \n",
