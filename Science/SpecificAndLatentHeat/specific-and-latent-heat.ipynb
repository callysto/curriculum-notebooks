    "### Specific Heat Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of heat required to change the temperature of a given material is given by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = m C \\Delta T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q$ represents heat in joules (J), $m$ represents mass kilograms (kg), and $\\Delta T$ represents the change in temperature in Celsius (°C) or kelvin (K). The parameter $C$ is an experimentally determined value characteristic of a particular material. This parameter is called the **specific heat** or **specific heat capacity** (J/kg$\\cdot$°C). The specific heat capacity of a material is determined by measuring the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the material by 1°C. For ordinary temperatures and pressures, the value of $C$ is considered constant. Values for the specific heat capacity of common materials are shown in the table below:\n",

    "**Answer:** Every material has two common \"critical temperature points\". These are the points at which the *state* of the material *changes*. For water, these points are at 0°C and 100°C. If heat is coming into a material *during a phase change*, then this energy is used to overcome the intermolecular forces between the molecules of the material.\n",

Immediately after the molecular bonds in the ice are broken, the molecules are moving (vibrating) at the same average speed as before, and so their average kinetic energy remains the same. *Temperature* is precisely a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a material.

    "**Solution:** Previously, we split the problem into three steps. It turns out that those steps correctly calculated the heat required to warm ice from -20°C to 0°C, water from 0°C to 100°C. and steam from 100°C to 200°C. What was absent was the latent heat required to complete the phase changes at 0°C and 100°C. Therefore, we need to **add two more steps**, which incorporate the above formulae. \n",

    "* The **specific heat capacity** of a material is an empirically determined value characteristic of a particular material. It is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the material by 1°C.\n",
    "* We use the formula $Q=mc\\Delta T$ to calculate the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a material in which there is no change of phase.\n",
    "* The **latent heat of fusion** ($H_f$) is defined as the amount of heat needed to melt 1 kg of a solid without a change in temperature.\n",
    "* The **latent heat of vaporization** ($H_v$) is define as the amount of heat needed to vaporise 1 kg of a liquid without a change in temperature.\n",
    "* We use the formula $Q=mH_f$ to calculate the heat required to change a material from a solid to a liquid, or from a liquid to a solid.\n",
    "* We use the formula $Q=mH_v$ to calculate the heat required to change a material from a liquid to a gas, or from a gas to a liquid.\n",
    "* If heat is being taken away, then a negative sign must be placed in front of $H_f$ and $H_v$.\n",
    "* We use a combination of the above formulae to compute the heat required to change a material from an initial temperature to a final temperature when one (or more) phase changes occur across a range of temperatures.\n",
