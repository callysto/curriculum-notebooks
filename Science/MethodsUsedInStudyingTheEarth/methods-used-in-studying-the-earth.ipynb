These changes occur over millions of years and can be observed from the surface by observing land forms and types of rocks in  the area. There are many specific indications that showcase different changes. These indications can be separated into two categories, sudden change and gradual change.\n", "### Sudden Change\n", "After a change occurs in the subsurface, it is brought to the surface as an event that is commonly classified as a \"natural disaster\" such as earthquakes and volcanoes. The main cause of these events is plate tectonics. Earth's crust is divided into many pieces called plates which move in relation to one another. Typically, plates move at a rate of 10cm/yr which seems very slow. As the plates move, they exert pressure on one another can result in earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"scrolled": true}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from __future__ import print_function\n", "from IPython.display import Image, HTML, clear_output\n", "from ipywidgets import interact, interactive, fixed, interact_manual\n", "import ipywidgets as widgets\n", "import random"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<img src=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/images/parks-plates_cascadia_subduction_zone_revised-01.jpg\" alt=\"Volcano\" width=\"420\" height=\"200\"/>"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Figure 1: Cross section of the volcano.
