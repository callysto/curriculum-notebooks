    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists describe the **Solar System** as the collection of objects orbiting the Sun. The Solar System formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a large **molecular cloud**, or **nebula**. This giant cloud, full of gas and dust, formed during an earlier period within the history of the universe. As the nebula contracted under gravity, it began to swirl faster and faster due to the conservation of angular momentum. This resulted in the formation of a **protoplanetary disk**. The majority of the nebula's matter collected at the centre of this disk to form a sphere, known as a **protostar**. The remaining matter continued to spin around the center, clumping together by gravity to form the **planets**. As the pressure and temperature increased at the centre of the protostar, some of the hydrogen began to fuse into helium - a process known as **nuclear fusion**. The energy released from this process initiated a self-sustaining fusion reaction and a new star, the **Sun**, was born. Streams of energized particles flowing outward from the Sun, known as the **solar wind**, blew away much of the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space. This ended the planetary formation process. This model of the Solar System's formation is known as the **nebular hypothesis**. However, it is important to remember that the scientific study of the Solar System and its formation remain active areas of research with many questions yet to be answered.\n",

    "## Main Features of the Solar System\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features of the Solar System include the **Sun**, the **planets**, and the **asteroid belt**. There are eight planets within the Solar System. The four closest to the Sun are called the **rocky inner planets**. These are named **Mercury**, **Venus**, **Earth**, and **Mars**. The rocky planets are composed primarily of rock and metal. During the formation of the rocky inner planets, these heavier substances were able to resist the high temperatures experienced close to the Sun. Most of the lighter substances within this region of the protoplanetary disk were vaporized and blown away by the solar wind. Further from the Sun, where the temperatures are much colder, the lighter substances and gases coalesced to form the two **gas giants**, **Jupiter** and **Saturn**. They are named the gas giants because more than 90% of their mass consists of hydrogen and helium. Their composition is therefore similar to that of the Sun, though they are considerably smaller in size. Beyond the gas giants, where the temperatures are even colder, are the two **ice giants**, **Uranus** and **Neptune**. Unlike the gas giants, the ice giants consist of only about 20% hydrogen and helium while the remaining mass is thought to consist of heavier elements, such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. The ice giants formed primarily by the gradual accumulation of frozen solids and ice which formed in the cold outermost regions of the protoplanetary disk."

    "## Lesser Features of the Solar System\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dwarf planets**: A dwarf planet is similar to a regular planet in that it has a spherical shape and directly orbits a star. However unlike planets, dwarf planets share their orbital zone with other bodies of significant size. For example, **Ceres** is located within the asteroid belt and thus shares its orbital zone with many asteroids. **Pluto**, **Eris**, **Haumea**, and **Makemake** are dwarf planets located in the **Kuiper belt**, a region of space located beyond Neptune that contains many small bodies, all remnants from the Solar System's formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asteroids**: Asteroids are small oddly-shaped objects scattered throughout the solar system. The vast majority of asteroids are located in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. There are two additional groups of asteroids, known as the **Trojan asteroids**, that are co-orbital with Jupiter. Asteroids are composed primarily of nickel, iron, titanium, and water.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meteoroids**: A meteoroid is a space rock, typically less than 1 m wide. Most meteoroids are fragments from comets or asteroids, while others originate from the debris ejected from impacts. When a meteor impacts Earth, the recoverable fragments are called **meteorites**. It is estimated that 25 million meteoroids enter the Earth's atmosphere each day, though most are below 1 mm in size. While most of these impacts go unnoticed, meteors on the scale of tens of centimeters to several meters can be observed as **shooting stars** at night.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comets**: A comet is a small, icy object that usually follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun. As it passes close to the Sun, it warms and releases gases that streak behind it like a tail. It is this feature that distinguishes a comet from an asteroid. Most comets are believed to originate from either the Kuiper belt, or the **Oort cloud**, a spherical cloud of icy objects surrounding our solar system. The Oort cloud extends well-beyond Neptune and into interstellar space.\n",
