    "In this notebook, we imported data that identifies climate trends in the provinces of Canada. We utilized data cleaning, compared different variables to climate, and visualized winter, summer, and annual temperature maps for all provinces. If you would like to learn more about climate data in Canada, the Canadian Government provides information about historical climate data, known as [historical climate data](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/). \n",
