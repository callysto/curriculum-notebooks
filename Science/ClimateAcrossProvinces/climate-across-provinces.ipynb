We utilized data cleaning, compared different variables to climate, and visualized the hottest and coldest climates annually. If you would like to learn more about climate data in Canada, the Canadian Government provides information in regard to historical climate data, known as [historical climate data](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/). \n",
