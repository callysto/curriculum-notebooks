    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When light shines onto the surface of an object, some of the light is reflected, while the rest is either absorbed or transmitted. We can imagine the light consisting of many narrow beams that travel in straight-line paths called **rays**. The light rays that strike the surface are called the **incident rays**. The light rays that reflect off the surface are called the **reflected rays**. This model of light is called the **ray model**, and it can be used to describe many aspects of light, including the reflection and formation of images by plane and spherical mirrors.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/law_of_reflection.svg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the angles of the incident and reflected rays, we first draw the **normal**, which is the line perpendicular to the surface. The **angle of incidence, $\\theta_{i}$,** is the angle between the incident ray and the normal. Likewise, the **angle of reflection, $\\theta_{r}$,** is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal. Notice in the image above that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. This is known as the **law of reflection**, and it can be expressed by the following equation:\n",

    "$$\\theta_{r} = \\theta_{i}$$\n",

    "In this notebook, the reflection of light off of plane and spherical mirrors was examined. In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Light can be thought of as a collection of narrow beams called **rays** which travel in straight-line paths. This conceptualization of light is called the **ray model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **law of reflection** states that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_{r} = \\theta_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plane mirrors** always produce a virtual image behind the mirror. This image has the same size and orientation of the object, and the image and object are always equidistant from the mirror.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A spherical mirror** is formed from a section of a sphere. If the reflecting surface is on the inside of the spherical section, the mirror is **concave**. If it is on the outside, the mirror is **convex**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **ray diagram** can be used to find the location and characteristics of a reflection in concave and convex mirrors. For concave mirrors, the characteristics of the possible images are summarized as follows: \n",
