    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When light shines onto the surface of an object, some of the light is reflected, while the rest is either absorbed or transmitted. We can imagine the light consisting of many narrow beams that travel in straight-line paths called **rays**. The light rays that strike the surface are called the **incident rays**. The light rays that reflect off the surface are called the **reflected rays**. This model of light is called the **ray model**, and it can be used to describe many aspects of light, including the reflection and formation of images by plane and spherical mirrors.\n",

    "To measure the angles of the incident and reflected rays, we first draw the **normal**, which is the line perpendicular to the surface. The **angle of incidence, $\\theta_{i}$,** is the angle between the incident ray and the normal. Likewise, the **angle of reflection, $\\theta_{r}$,** is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal. The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the reflecting surface all lie within the same plane. This is shown in the figure above. Notice that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. This is known as the **law of reflection**, and it can be expressed by the following equation:\n",

    " For a very smooth surface, such as a mirror, almost all of the light is reflected to produce a **specular reflection**. In a specular reflection, the reflected light rays are parallel to one another and point in the same direction. This allows specular reflections to form images. If the surface is not very smooth, then the light may bounce off of the surface in various directions. This produces a **diffuse reflection**. Diffuse reflections cannot form images. \n",

We can imagine that each small section of the rough surface is like a flat plane orientated differently than the sections around it. Since each of these sections is orientated differently, the angle of incidence is different at each section. This causes the reflected rays to scatter.\n"

    "A **plane mirror** is simply a mirror made from a flat (or planar) surface. These types of mirrors are commonly found in bedroom or bathroom fixtures. When an object is reflected in a plane mirror, the image of the object appears to be located behind the mirror. This is because our brains interpret the reflected light rays entering our eyes as having travelled in straight-line paths. The light rays entering our eyes simply do not contain enough information for our brains to differentiate between a straight-line path and a path that changed direction due to a reflection.  \n",

Since the light rays do not actually go behind the mirror, they are represented as projections using dashed lines. If a film were placed at the image location behind the mirror, it would not be able to capture the image. As a result, this type of image is called a **virtual image**. \n",

    "For objects reflected in a plane mirror, the distance of the image from the mirror, $d_{i}$, is always equal to the distance of the object from the mirror, $d_{o}$.

    "* Light can be thought of as a collection of narrow beams called **rays** which travel in straight-line paths. This conceptualization of light is called the **ray model**.\n",
