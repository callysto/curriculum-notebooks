    "In this notebook we learned about different types of materials and how light interacts with them, either being absorbed, transmitted, or reflected. Depending on the capacity to allow light to pass through them, they can be either opaque, transparent and translucent. We found that there are opaque objects that are luminous (such as the sun) and opaque objects that are illuminated (such as the moon).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned the Law of Reflection: given an opaque surface and an incidence ray, the incident angle (with respect to the normal) is equal to the reflective angle (with respect to the normal). \n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that when we point a ray of light through a transparent surface, a portion of the light is reflected while another portion is *refracted*. We learned about Snell's law and conducted a simple experiment with different materials. We found what the critical angle was two materials, assuming the first material is a diamond."
