    "\n",
    "A logarithmic scale is a nonlinear scale often used when analyzing a large range of quantities. Instead of increasing in equal increments, each interval is increased by a factor of the base of the logarithm. Typically, a base 10 and base $e$ scale are used. In this notebook, we will use base 10. \n",

    "Let's say you have a variable $y$ which [grows exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth), that is, \n",
    "\n",
    "on the first day, $y=10$, \n",
    "\n",
    "on the second day, $y = 100$, \n",
    "\n",
    "on the third day, $y = 1000$...\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that every day, the value of y will increase by a factor of ten.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a logarithmic scale is useful when the largest numbers in the data are hundreds or thousands of times larger than the smallest numbers. \n"
