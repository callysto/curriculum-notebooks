    "## Plotting Daily and Cumulative COVID-19 Cases per Country on a Logarithmic Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore the logarithmic scale (also known as the log scale) and we will explore how the log scale can help us determine if a country is experiencing exponential growth in the number of reported COVID-19 cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a logarithmic scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "A logarithmic scale is a nonlinear scale often used when analyzing a large range of quantities. Instead of increasing in equal increments, each interval is increased by a factor of the base of the logarithm. Typically, a base 10 and base $e$ scale are used. In this notebook, we will use base 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a variable $y$ which [grows exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth), that is, \n",
    "\n",
    "on the first day, $y=10$, \n",
    "\n",
    "on the second day, $y = 100$, \n",
    "\n",
    "on the third day, $y = 1000$...\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that every day, the value of y will increase by a factor of ten.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a logarithmic scale is useful when the largest numbers in the data are hundreds or thousands of times larger than the smallest numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "One application of the logarithmic scale is the Richter scale used to measure the power of an earthquake.\n"
