The ancients believed that for most objects, the natural state was rest. For instance, you slide a chair along the floor and then is comes to a stop. You drop a rock from your hand, and it falls to the ground and stops. You paddle a boat to get it moving, and when you stop paddling, the boat stops. Everything likes to stop. If you want something to move, you have to push it, and keep pushing if you want it to keep moving. \n", "\n", "Planets, and the moon, were considered special because they keep moving without anything obvious pushing them. At least to the ancients, they were considered special. \n", "\n", "Newton said **No**. Things that are moving, will keep moving, until something makes them stop. When you push a chair across the floor, the reason it stops is because of the force of friction from the floor acting on the chair's leg. A boat stops in the water because of the drag force of the water on the boat. Even a curling rock will eventually come to rest, because there is still a tiny bit of friction between the rock and the very slippery icy surface of the curling rink. Everything that comes to a stop does so because of some force acting on it. \n", "\n", "Planets, and the moon, don't stop moving because there is nothing in space acting as friction to slow down their motion. \n", "\n", "Newton also noted that moving objects will move in a straight line, with constant velocity, unless there is a force acting on it. So the curling rock moves straight until it hits something, resulting in a force that pushes it off course from a straight line. A rock that you throw would travel straight, until you notice that gravity is pulling it into a curved path as it falls to the ground. \n", "\n", "Even the planet, and moon, travel in curved paths (elllipses) because the force of gravity is causing them to move away from the straight line path they would take if there was no force on them.\n", "\n", "It was Newton who realized that the force that causes a rock to fall to the ground is the same force that keeps the moon going around the Earth.\n", "\n", "This property of a body to stay in uniform motion (or rest) is called inertia."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Simulation of Newton's first law\n", "\n", "We can create a simulation of Newton's first law by doing a numerical simulation of curling.\n", "\n", "Below, we have four circles (curling stones) in a line.
