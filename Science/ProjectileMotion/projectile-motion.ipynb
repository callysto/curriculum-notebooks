From throwing a dart to shooting a basketball to medieval cannons used during sieges, all of these objects are ruled by the same basic principles. The effects of air resistance will be ignored to make things simpler. However in reality air resistance can play a significant role in projectile motion.\n","\n","Objects travelling in two dimensions will constantly be pulled down to earth and forced into a curved trajectory known as a parabola. Take a look at the following animation from [Glenbrook High Schools](http://gbhsweb.glenbrook225.org/gbs/science/phys/mmedia/vectors/nhlp.html). What do you notice about the velocity vectors in the horizontal and vertical directions?\n","\n","<img src=\"./images/parabola.gif\" alt=\"Parabola Animation\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n","\n","Projectile motion can be broken into two components, **horizontal ($x$)** and **vertical ($y$)**, that can be analyzed separately. These two dimensions are **independent**, the only variable they share is time **time**. This means that changes in the vertical distance, speed, and acceleration will not affect the horizontal components and vice versa.\n","\n","### Vertical Component\n","\n","Due to the force of gravity, the object will accelerate towards the center of the Earth. We will assume $ \\vec a $ is constant for projectile motion and equal to $ 9.81  m/s^2$. The five variables we'll use for **uniformly accelerated motion** are acceleration, initial velocity, final velocity, distance (height), and time.\n","\n","$\\vec a , \\vec v_i , \\vec v_f , \\vec d_y , t$\n","\n","There are five kinematic equations we use, where each one contains four of these five variables.\n","\n","$\\vec a_{ave} = \\frac{\\vec v_f - \\vec v_i}{t}$\n","\n","$\\vec d = \\vec v_i t + \\frac12\\ \\vec a t^2$\n","\n","$\\vec d = \\vec v_f t - \\frac12\\ \\vec a t^2$\n","\n","$\\vec d = \\frac{\\vec v_f + \\vec v_i}{2} t$\n","\n","$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a d$\n","\n","### Horizontal Component\n","\n","There is no force acting horizontally. Therefore there is no acceleration so it is **uniform motion** ($ \\vec v_i = \\vec v_f = \\vec v_x $).\n","\n","Horizontal uniform motion involves variables: velocity, range (distance travelled horizontally), and time. \n","\n","$\\vec v_x , \\vec d_x , t$\n","\n","These three variables are related by the uniform motion equation:\n","\n","$\\vec v_x = \\frac {\\vec d_x}{t}$\n","\n","### Projectiles Fired at an Angle\n","\n","The horizontal velocity $ \\vec v_x $ will remain the same throughout the flight (uniform motion) while $ \\vec v_y $ will decrease to the top of its trajectory and then increase downwards. The initial horizontal and vertical velocities can be found using trigonometry. For example, a projectile fired at 31 m/s at an angle of 50&deg; up from horizontal:\n","\n","\\begin{array}{cc}\n","x &y \\\\ \n","cos(50^{\\circ}) = \\frac{adj}{hyp} = \\frac{\\vec v_x}{31\\ m/s} &sin(50^{\\circ}) = \\frac{opp}{hyp} = \\frac{\\vec v_y}{31\\ m/s} \\\\\n","\\vec v_x = (31\\ m/s)\\ cos(50^{\\circ}) &\\vec v_y = (31\\ m/s)\\ sin(50^{\\circ}) \\\\ \n","\\vec v_x = 19.9264\\ m/s &\\vec v_y = 23.7474\\ m/s \\\\ \n","\\vec v_x = 20\\ m/s &\\vec v_y = 24\\ m/s \\\\ \n","\\end{array}\n","\n","The following code cell creates an interactive graph where you can use sliders to modify the initial velocity $\\vec v_i$ and launch angle $\\theta$ and see how the projectile's trajectory changes.
