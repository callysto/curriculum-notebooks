Before sending you off to space, your team gave you a variety of crop seeds, however there's a problem! The bag containing the crop seeds split open and spilled everywhere during your space travel! You picked up the ones you could find, but you now have no idea what it grows or what is special about them.\n",

To help you with this, you will work with a special robot-helper who will help write code for you, named ***Crop-3PO***.\n",

The genetic material (commonly called a transgene) is inserted into the nucleus of a plant cell where it integrates into the plant DNA.  If integration of the DNA is successful, the plant cell, now described as a transgenic cell, divides and grows into a genetically modified (or transgenic) plant.  The genetic modification is permanent and will be passed on to the seeds of the transgenic (GMO) plant."

    "Plant traits are desirable **phenotypes** (observable expression of a gene, it's functional use), and can be almost anything as long as they are useful. Century after century, farmers and botanists have selected plants that have desirable traits (sweet taste, size, etc) and cross bred them over time to produce more of that crop. With the use of modern technology however, we have successfully determined various genes that result in different plant traits. Some traits are not just the addition or enhancement of something, but can also be a suppression (for instead, delayed ripening). Instead of breeding over many generations, we can directly insert the gene to create a genetically engineered (GE) or modified plant, and have more direct and reliable results.\n",
