# Contributing Guidelines
Create a branch off of staging for your Jira task.
After your content review as assigned on Jira, make the recommended changes and open a pull request from your branch to staging, for your code review.

## Organization
If you have files accompanying your notebook they should be in a directory along with your notebook.
Images should all be in an `images` folder.

## Naming Conventions
Your notebook name should be kebab-case and it should not contain your Jira task identifier. 
If your notebook is in a directory, your directory should have the same name as your notebook but in UpperCamelCase. 
All files should have descriptive names.
