# Curriculum Notebooks
Home of curriculum related notebook content developed by Callysto developers. These notebooks are designed to help teachers bring computational thinking into their math, science, social sciences, and humanities courses. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on the remote callysto hub for development purposes.

Sign in to the [Callysto hub](https://hub.callysto.ca) and start your server.

Create a new Terminal instance in the hub and then clone this git repo. You should now see this repo in the hub.

Read the [training manual](https://github.com/callysto/training-manual) before you begin notebook development.
