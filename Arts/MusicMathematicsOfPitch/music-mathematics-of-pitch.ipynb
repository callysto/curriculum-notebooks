    "Notes have a number of characteristics, including the loudness, the duration, the pitch, timbre, and envelope. Perhaps you already know what these mean: certainly the loudness and duration, or length in time,  should be clear. The pitch is basically whether a note sounds high (like a young child's voice) or low (like a man's voice). Timbre characterizes the difference between, say, a flute and an electric guitar, when the notes from the flute are very clean and pure sounding, while an electric guitar can sound harsh and rough. The envelope describes how the note evolves over time: does it have a sharp initial attack, is it sustained for a long period, does it decay slowly to silence or stop abruptly.\n",

    "\n",
    "People in ancient civilizations noticed a long time ago that notes of certain pitches sound \"good\" together. We often say such notes sound harmonious. They also noticed that the pitch of sound produced by singers, or instruments, were somehow related to the size, shape and weight of the singer or instrument. For instance, a big man would typically sing in a low pitch, while a small woman or child would sing in a higher pitch. A large drum makes a deep, low sound while a small drum or wood block would make a high sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pitch is related to the rate of vibration of an object producing sounds. Although the ancients could not measure this directly, certainly they would have noticed by touching their throats while singing, that a low-pitched sound has a slow vibration, and a high-pitched sound has a faster vibration. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now measure the frequency of notes, and discover that the range of human voices produce vibrations with frequency as low as 80 cycles per second (for a male bass singer) to as high as 1000 cycles per second (for a female soprano singer). \n",

    "It was perhaps the ancient Greeks who first noticed a connection between harmonious notes and mathematics. They observed that strings of different lengths, but the same thickness and tension, would often produce harmonious pairs of tones if the string lengths were in the ratio of simple fractions. You may have noticed this yourself if you play a guitar or ukelele. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, one string that was half the length of another would produce a note that was an octave higher that the other string. A string that was two-thirds the length would produce the C-to-G interval, which we now call \"a fifth.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The Greeks didn't know it, but the frequency (or pitch) was directly related to the reciprocal of these fractions. So the string of one-half (1/2) length would have 2 times the frequency. The string of two-thirds (2/3) length would have three-halves (3/2) the frequency. \n",

    "Another way to describe the circle of fifths is to measure the size of the semitone. We need a number that solves $x^{12} = 2$\n",

    "Now this has solved our problem with tuning. All our notes are related to each other by powers of 2. Shifting up and down the scale amounts to multiplying or dividing by some power of two, so every notes stays in the proper relationship to other notes. There are distinct 12 notes in this system. If we play them all, we get the chromatic scale which includes the notes\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Musical notes have many characteristics, and an important one is the pitch. Pitch is related to the frequency of vibrations for whatever is creating the sound. Human singers can sing notes with frequencies ranging from about 80 cycles per second, to 1000 cycles per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scales for notes in Western music are based on the observation that notes of certain frequencies sound harmonious together. The key observation is that if the frequencies of the notes are in the ratio small integers (the fractions have a small numerator and denominator) then the notes often sound good together. \n",
    "\n",
    "The C major scale (C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C) is given by frequencies in the ratios 1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, and 2. A major scale in any other key should have the same ratio of frequencies which are these small integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Circle of Fifths shows us that these fractions cannot work out exactly. This becomes a problem for musicians who must play music in different keys, with various instruments. The solution was to create the well-tempered scale, where notes are related to each other by fractional powers of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the well-tempered scale uses integer powers of $2^{1/12} = 1.0594631$, where the 2 comes from the fact that an octave represents a doubling in frequency, and the 12 represents the 12 distinct, evenly scaled notes in the chromatic scale. Using this well-tempered method gives a very good approximation to the simple fractions that the ancient Greeks preferred, but still sounds good to our ears. "
