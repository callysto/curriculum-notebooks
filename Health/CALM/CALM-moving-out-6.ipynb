These dataframes are like spreadsheets, and the code will look a little complicated, but it shouldn't be too bad.\n","\n","### Meal Plan\n","\n","Before we get into dataframes, though, you need to create a meal plan. With the [Canadian Food Guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/food-guide-snapshot/) in mind, complete a 7-day meal plan considering nutritionally balanced choices at each meal. You can choose to eat out only twice on this menu.\n","\n","You will then use this to decide your grocery needs for one week.\n","\n","Replace the words \"meal\" in the cell below with the meals you
