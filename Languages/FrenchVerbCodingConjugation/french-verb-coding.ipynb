    "```\n",
    "The variable x is a *string*, which a short list of characters, like a word. This will be what we use to check against the correct answer. In our case, the correct answer is \"ferme\". To check if the answer is correct we will employ an `if` statement, which will then `print` a message:\n",

    "- If the answer was incorrect we used !=, which means \"does not equal\" (like $\\ne$).\n",

In our case, how could we write a program that checks the correct answer for any verb, tense, and personal pronoun? This would be a generalization of the simple case that we constructed above.

    "2. See if the remainder of the verb has the correct ending.\n",
    "3. Make sure all answers are correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this we will be employing the use of a *list*. A list is a data type which has some sort of ordering to it. The ordering gives us the means to *index* an *element* of the list. For example, we have the list:\n",

    "\n",
    "If we wanted to perform a simple check, say whether or not they simply got the correct form, and not necessarily the correct spelling, we would use the following:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(0,6):\n",

    "**What does the `for` statement do?**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(0,6):\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is another essential programming tool known as the `for` loop. Within the `for` loop, the indented code block is executed, then the next iteration of the loop is performed, in our case the index $i$ is increased to $i+1$. This continues until all iterations are done. It provides a means of counting or iterating through a process. In our case we want to iterate over every element in the list and perform the check in the `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the code `range(0,6)` tells us the index `i` will start at `i=0` and end at `i=5`. It stops before 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `if` statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we used the \"!=\" to see if two strings are not equal to each other. Firstly, we have declared a variable in the loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n = len(endings[i])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is simply the length of the ending. So for `endings[5]`, which is the string 'ent', the length is `n = 3`. This gives us a way of checking the last letters of the respective answer. We accomplish by using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "answers[i][-n:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first index, `answers[i]` gives us the `i+1` element of the list answers (since we begin indexing from 0). e.g. `answers[3] = 'x4'`. The second index we used, `answers[i][-n:]`, indexes the element of the list. How are we indexing an already indexed list you might ask? Well, this is because a string is conveniently broken up into the characters that make it up. This gives us a way of indexing any \"letter\" of the string. For example, if `x1 = 'mange'` then `x1[3] = 'g'`. This is very nice for us, since we can employ this to check the ending of their answers. To index the last element of a string, or a list, we use the negative. e.g. `x1[-1] = 'e'`. To take out an entire section of a list or string we used \"slice notation\", this is why there is the extra colon. e.g. `x1[-3:] = 'nge'`. In our case we only wanted to index the last `n` letters of the string because this is the amount of letters in the ending that we wanted to check against. If all the answers were correct then the entire `for` loop would run and the `if` statement would never be fulfilled!\n",
    "\n",
