    "for i in range(0,6):\n",

Within the `for` loop, the indented code block is executed, then the next iteration of the loop is performed, in our case the index $i$ is increased to $i+1$. This continues until all iterations are done. It provides a means of counting or iterating through a process. In our case we want to iterate over every element in the list and perform the check in the `if` statement.\n",

    "\n",
    "Again we used the \"!=\" to see if two strings are not equal to each other. Firstly, we have declared a variable in the loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n = len(endings[i])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is simply the length of the ending. So for `endings[5]`, which is the string 'ent', the length is `n = 3`. This gives us a way of checking the last letters of the respective answer. We accomplish by using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "answers[i][-n:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first index, `answers[i]` gives us the `i+1` element of the list answers (since we begin indexing from 0). e.g. `answers[3] = 'x4'`. The second index we used, `answers[i][-n:]`, indexes the element of the list. How are we indexing an already indexed list you might ask? Well, this is because a string is conveniently broken up into the characters that make it up. This gives us a way of indexing any \"letter\" of the string. For example, if `x1 = 'mange'` then `x1[3] = 'g'`. This is very nice for us, since we can employ this to check the ending of their answers. To index the last element of a string, or a list, we use the negative. e.g. `x1[-1] = 'e'`. To take out an entire section of a list or string we used \"slice notation\", this is why there is the extra colon. e.g. `x1[-3:] = 'nge'`. In our case we only wanted to index the last `n` letters of the string because this is the amount of letters in the ending that we wanted to check against. If all the answers were correct then the entire `for` loop would run and the `if` statement would never be fulfilled!\n",

    "In this Jupyter Notebook by Callysto you learned the basics of French verb conjugation in the present tense. You also learned about some basic aspects used in programming such as `for` loops, `if` statements. You additionally learned about strings, lists, and indexing. You were also challenged to see to create your own program  for dealing with irregular verbs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that we could expose the structure of the French verb conjugation rules to compose a program that creates the correct responses to conjugate a verb in the present tense. This is somewhat of a hallmark of coding. Taking some sort of structure of the problem at hand and exposing in the form of generalizable and applicable written code. Breaking down problems in this fashion is essential to computational thinking. \n",
