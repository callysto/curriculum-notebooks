    "# Self-referential sentences, in English\n",
    "\n",
    "April-June, 2023. (Michael Lamoureux) \n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in creating self-referential sentences like the following:\n",
    "- This sentence has four e’s in it.\n",
    "- This sentence has five e’s in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these sentences are true, as the count (four, five) matches the actual number of e's in the sentence. However, the sentence \"This sentence has six e’s in it\" is false. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to create such self-referential in the Cree language, which you can see here: [counting-letters-cree.ipynb](counting-letters-cree.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an initial attempt in English. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create some Python code to make a sentence that tells you how many of each letter it has, and get the count correct. This is tricky, because the numbers in the sentence are made up of letters, and you don't know in advance how many letters there will be in the completed sentence!\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to treat the sentence as an object that gets transformed by the code, based on the count of letters in the sentence. As you update the sentence, you then update the count of letters. Hopefully the updates finally converge to a correct sentence.  This is called a **fixed point** in the set of sentences, under this transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking for fixed points in a dynamical system is an important topic in pure and applied mathematics. It is interesting to see it show up in languages as well. "
