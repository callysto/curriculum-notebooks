    "\n",
    "Compositions of functions may sound complicated, but it basically means a \"function of a function\". As with most mathematical language, that description isn't particularily enlightening. So, let's start with an example. Suppose you have two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = 2x$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(x) = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "While keeping these simple functions in mind, let's work our way through a few definitions. A composition of functions defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$f \\circ g = f[g(x)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "where this is read as $f$ of $g$ of $x$. This notation is telling us to write $f(x)$ as a function of $g(x)$, so rather than a function of a variable, it's becoming a function of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f[g(x)] = \\underset{\\substack{\\downarrow \\\\ \\text{Inserted g(x) at x}}}{2 \\times g(x)} = 6$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it with more complex functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = x + 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(x) = x^2 - 4$\n",
    "\n",
    "So $f \\circ g$ with these functions becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "$f[g(x)] =\\underset{\\substack{\\downarrow \\\\ \\text{inserted g(x) at x}}}{g(x)} + \n",
    "\\overset{\\substack{\\text{a constant} \\\\ \\uparrow} }{5} = \n",
    "\\underbrace{x^2 - 4}_\\text{insert definition of g(x) for x} + 5 = x^2 + 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $g \\circ f$ would become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$g[f(x)] = f^2(x) - 4 = (x+5)^2 - 4 = x^2 + 10x + 25 - 4 = x^2 + 10x + 21$\n",
    "\n",

    "Compositions of functions are used in disciplines such as physics and engineering. Whenever you make a substitution in your analysis you are using compositions of functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to calculate the kinetic energy of an object undergoing uniform circular motion we can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$T(v) = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $T$ is the object's kinetic energy, $v$ is its speed, and $m$ is its mass. For circular motion the formula for speed is \n",
    "\n",
    "$v = \\omega r$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\omega$ is the angular speed, or how quickly the angle changes as a function of time, and $r$ is the radius of the circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the kinetic energy of an object in uniform circular motion, we use composition of functions. Looking for the kinetic energy as a function of angular speed (or kinetic energy of speed of angular speed):\n",
    "\n",
    "$T(v(\\omega)) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\omega r \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Compositions of functions come down to making a substitution. We can also use those compositions of functions to visualize them in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, if you ever hear the phrase \"make a substitution\" you should be thinking \"composition of functions\"."
