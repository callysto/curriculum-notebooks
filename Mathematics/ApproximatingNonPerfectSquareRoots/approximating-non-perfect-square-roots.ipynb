Note that fractions can also be a perfect square. This will happen if the numerator and the denominator are both perfect squares. For example, ${\\frac{4}{9}}$ is a perfect square, because 4 is a perfect square, and 9 is a perfect square. \n", "\n", "We could identify whether a number was a perfect square by factoring it into its prime factors or by drawing out a square on grid paper and determining the area. Also, remember that squaring a number and taking the square root are **opposite operations**.\n", "\n", "Today, we will be looking at approximating **non-perfect squares**. Non-perfect squares are also **whole numbers** that are not a product of two identical integers or a product of two perfect squares. When we take the square root of these numbers, we won't get an integer, we will get a decimal number.\n", "\n", "For example: 16 is a perfect square. Why? Well, we can either take its square root, or we can prime factorize it. If we prime factorize, we would get 16 = 2$\\cdot$2$\\cdot$2$\\cdot$2. Now it may not look like that 16 is the product of two identical integers but it is. We can group the two's together and get 16 = 4 $\\cdot$ 4. So, 16 is a perfect square. And, if we were to take the square root of 16, we would end up with ${\\sqrt{16} = 4}$.\n", "\n", "In contrast, if we prime factorize a non-perfect square, we would find that it has extra unpaired prime factors.\n", "\n", "To illustrate this, let's prime factorize 72. After prime factorizing, we get: 72 = 2 $\\cdot$ 2 $\\cdot$ 2 $\\cdot$ 3 $\\cdot$ 3 or 72 = 2 $\\cdot$ 4 $\\cdot$ 9. So, we cannot write 72 as a product of perfect squares, we have a 2 which is unpaired. And we cannot write 72 as a product of identical integers either, since 2, 4, and 9 are different.\n", "\n", "Also, the prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,... are all non-perfect squares. This is because they have no factors other than 1 and themselves.\n", "\n", "### Why we need to approximate:\n", "\n", "We mentioned above that taking the square roots of non-perfect squares gives us a decimal number. More specifically, we will get an **irrational** decimal number. Irrational numbers are numbers that you cannot represent as a fraction, and square roots of non-perfect squares are an example of irrational numbers. A famous example is $\\sqrt{2} = 1.414213\\ldots$. $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number. It has no patterns in its decimal form, and it has infinite decimal places, so we cannot write it as a fraction.\n", "\n", "Because these numbers have infinite decimal places, there is no way we can store all of the digits in a computer, we would need one with infinite storge, and that is not physically possible. So as a consquence, we can only store a limited number of decimal places, but we lose accuracy. In many areas of science, engineering and in some areas of math, we often deal with quantities that we can only approximate. An example would be the area of circle, or the volume of a cone, which will often be an irrational number."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Ways To Approximate Non-Perfect Squares\n", "\n", "To begin, we will explore estimating the square roots of non-perfect squares using a calculator.\n", "\n", "### Using a Calculator\n", "\n", "The quickest and easiest way to approximate a non-perfect square is to use our calculators.
