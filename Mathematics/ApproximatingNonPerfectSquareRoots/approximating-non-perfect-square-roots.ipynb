    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a **perfect square** is a **whole number** (or positive integer) that is the product of **two identical integers** or **two other perfect squares**. Note that fractions can also be a perfect square. This will happen if the numerator and the denominator are both perfect squares. For example, ${\\frac{4}{9}}$ is a perfect square, because 4 is a perfect square, and 9 is a perfect square. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could identify whether a number was a perfect square by factoring it into its prime factors or by drawing out a square on grid paper and determining the area. Also, remember that squaring a number and taking the square root are **opposite operations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will be looking at approximating **non-perfect squares**. Non-perfect squares are also **whole numbers** that are not a product of two identical integers or a product of two perfect squares. When we take the square root of these numbers, we won't get an integer, we will get a decimal number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: 16 is a perfect square. Why? Well, we can either take its square root, or we can prime factorize it. If we prime factorize, we would get 16 = 2$\\cdot$2$\\cdot$2$\\cdot$2. Now it may not look like that 16 is the product of two identical integers but it is. We can group the two's together and get 16 = 4 $\\cdot$ 4. So, 16 is a perfect square. And, if we were to take the square root of 16, we would end up with ${\\sqrt{16} = 4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if we prime factorize a non-perfect square, we would find that it has extra unpaired prime factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's prime factorize 72. After prime factorizing, we get: 72 = 2 $\\cdot$ 2 $\\cdot$ 2 $\\cdot$ 3 $\\cdot$ 3 or 72 = 2 $\\cdot$ 4 $\\cdot$ 9. So, we cannot write 72 as a product of perfect squares, we have a 2 which is unpaired. And we cannot write 72 as a product of identical integers either, since 2, 4, and 9 are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,... are all non-perfect squares. This is because they have no factors other than 1 and themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we need to approximate:\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned above that taking the square roots of non-perfect squares gives us a decimal number. More specifically, we will get an **irrational** decimal number. Irrational numbers are numbers that you cannot represent as a fraction, and square roots of non-perfect squares are an example of irrational numbers. A famous example is $\\sqrt{2} = 1.414213\\ldots$. $\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number. It has no patterns in its decimal form, and it has infinite decimal places, so we cannot write it as a fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these numbers have infinite decimal places, there is no way we can store all of the digits in a computer, we would need one with infinite storge, and that is not physically possible. So as a consquence, we can only store a limited number of decimal places, but we lose accuracy. In many areas of science, engineering and in some areas of math, we often deal with quantities that we can only approximate. An example would be the area of circle, or the volume of a cone, which will often be an irrational number."

    "## Ways To Approximate Non-Perfect Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will explore estimating the square roots of non-perfect squares using a calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "The quickest and easiest way to approximate a non-perfect square is to use our calculators. Take the number you wish to approximate, find the ${\\sqrt{}}$ key, and apply it. Now, depending on how many decimal places you keep, your approximation will be better or worse. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Approximate the square root of 11 to three decimal places: <br />\n",
    "We take the square root of 11 and get 3.3166247904... . If we take three decimal places, we will end up with 3.316 as our approximation. And, if we square this number, we get 10.995856. <br />\n",
    "    \n",
    "2) Approximate the square root of 45 to five decimal places: <br />\n",
    "Applying the square root key gives us 6.7082039325... . Taking five decimal places will give us: 6.70820. If we square this number, we get 44.99994724. <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Approximate the square root of 27 to one decimal place: <br />\n",
    "Once again applying the square root key, we obtain 5.19611524227... . If we take one decimal place, we get 5.1. Squaring this number gives us 26.01, which is not very exact at all! <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see above, taking fewer decimal places resulted in us losing accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will explore the relationship between the accuracy of our estimate and the number of decimal places we keep. Choose an integer by adjusting the first slider, then choose the number of decimal places to keep with the second slider."

    "<img src=\"images/Example2_Pt1.jpg\">\n",

    "Now we can see that the side length of the imperfect square is closer to 11 than it is to 12. Now, we can apply what we have seen from the number line activity. We can either guess the side length visually, or we can find an estimate by calculating it using the steps above. Calculating gives a better estimate, so after doing so, we find the estimated side length equal to 11.39130... . \n",

If you think you have the right squares, try to estimate the side length for the non-perfect square and press the \"Check the results\" button.\n",
