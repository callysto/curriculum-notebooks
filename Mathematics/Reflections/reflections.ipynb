    "\n",

    "Since the $x$-axis is perfectly horizontal,\n",
    "this line from point to point has to be perfectly vertical,\n",

    "\n",
    "* A point and its reflection across the $x$-axis have equal but opposite $y$-coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is meant by that is if a point has a $y$-coordinate of, say, 17,\n",
    "its reflection has the $y$-coordinate -17.\n",
    "More generally, if a point has a $y$-coordinate of $a$, its reflection has the $y$-coordinate $-a$.\n",

    "In this notebook, we saw how to reflect over the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, the line $y = x$, and combining reflection.\n",
    "We've also made a distinction between reflecting a point, reflecting the graph of a function, and reflecting the function itself.\n",
    "Reflections of points and graphs are geometric ideas, manipulating plots;\n",
    "reflections of functions is about manipulating equations,\n",
    "although\n",
    "\n",
    "The studies of statistics and of the sciences depend heavily on the skills learned in later math courses, especially Calculus courses.\n",
    "A lot of time is spent in Calculus courses analyzing functions and to do this, it is usually helpful to have a clear image in one's mind of the function being analyzed.\n",
    "Understanding reflections of graphs and functions is one step towards forming such a clear image.\n",
    "For instance, you might already know what the graph of $y = 10^x$ looks like,\n",
    "but using the techniques covered in this notebook,\n",
    "you can also tell what $y = -10^x$, $y = 10^{-x}$, $y = -10^{-x}$, and $x = 10^y$ look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing when a function is \"even\" or \"odd\" also has its uses.\n",
    "A typical question in a Calculus class is to find the area underneath a curve and above the $x$-axis.\n",
    "If the curve is given by an even function, then the area to the right of the $y$-axis is the same as the area to the left.\n",
    "That means we can get away with only calculating half the area and then doubling the result.\n",
    "Doubling a number is easier than most things in math, so this can be a time saver."
