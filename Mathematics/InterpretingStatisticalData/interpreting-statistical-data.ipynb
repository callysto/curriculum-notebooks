    "### 1B. Sampling Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider now the following context, inspired by real-world application of statistics. We want to obtain the average (mean) value of a statistic over a very large number of cases. For example, we could be interested in the average height of people in Canada. In order to obtain the *exact answer*, we would need to measure the height of all people living in Canada. This is obviously impossible. So we need to proceed in a different way: we will select a **random sample** of the Canadian population and obtain the height measurements of the people in that sample. And the question that naturally occurs is: how can we deduce anything about the average height of the whole population from this sample? Surprisingly, we will see that we can say something, using the notions of **confidence level**, **confidence interval** and **margin of error**, concepts you might have heard about especially in opinion polls. This is based on non-trivial statistics, and we will not explore the technical aspects, but illustrate these notions with concrete examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence interval and confidence level\n",
    "So there exists a quantity $x$ we want to estimate because we can not obtain it exactly (the average height of people living in Canada in our example). We have measured the height of a random sample of $n$ people, let's denote it by  $\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important point related to sampling data is to estimate the mean of a quantity, that is, we will not compute a single number to approximate $x$, but an **interval** $(x_\\text{low},x_\\text{high})$. So we decide to lose *precision*, as an interval is less precise than a single number. The key point is that we want to be **confident**  that the value $x$ is in that interval. This notion of confidence is important and we want to quantify it in some way. We would like to be able to say something like \"I am $95\\%$ confident that the value $x$ is in the interval $(x_\\text{low},x_\\text{high})$ I computed\". This is a sentence we read often with opinion polls, aimed at describing their **accuracy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for us, we want to understand how to interpret the expression \"$95\\%$ confident\". In our example about averaging the height of Canadian people, it can be understood as follows: if we were going to repeat *often* (ideally an infinite number of times ... obviously this is impossible) and *independently* (our samples are truly random) the process of:\n",
    "* selecting a random set of $n$ people\n",
    "* measuring the height of the sampled people, $\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\}$\n",
    "* using the same method to deduce from $\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\}$ the interval $(x_\\text{low},x_\\text{high})$\n",
    "\n",
    "then $95\\%$ of the intervals generated as above would contain the exact value $x$ we want to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have **no guarantee** about the precise interval $(x_\\text{low},x_\\text{high})$ we computed from a specific sample $\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\}$ but we expect it contains $x$ with probability $95\\%$. Note that we selected a confidence level that gives us an interval of 95%, as it's by far the most common number, but realistically we could set that level at whatever we wanted. Setting a higher confidence level results in a wider confidence interval (why?), whereas a lower confidence level results in a narrower confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computing a confidence interval for a given confidence level\n",
    "\n",
    "The question now is: if we want to have a given confidence level (so we chose it), what is the method to compute $(x_\\text{low},x_\\text{high})$ from $\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\}$? Let's denote the confidence level by $\\beta$, a real number between $0$ and $1$ ($\\beta=0.95$ means a confidence level of $95\\%$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The method to compute $(x_\\text{low},x_\\text{high})$ is as follows:\n",
    "* Step 1. We calculate the mean $\\overline{x}$ of the sampled set $\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\}$, and its standard deviation $s$.\n",
    "* Step 2. We find the **z-score** corresponding to the chosen confidence level $\\beta$ (we will not discuss in this notebook how these z-scores are obtained, but they can be read in a table, see http://www.statisticshowto.com/tables/z-table/ and we provide a separate notebook to compute it given $\\beta$).\n",
    "* Step 3. Calculate $\\displaystyle x_\\text{low}=\\overline{x}- z\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$ and $\\displaystyle x_\\text{high}= \\overline{x}+ z\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$. \n",
    "So our confidence interval is:\n",
    "$$(x_\\text{low},x_\\text{high}) = \\displaystyle \\left(\\overline{x}- z\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} ,\\overline{x}+ z\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments:** <br>\n",
    "This formula is actually quite intuitive. We can see that this confidence interval is centred around the mean of the sampled data ($\\overline{x}$), with some slack on both sides that depends on the standard deviation, the number of samples and the mysterious z-score. So intuitively, we assume that $\\overline{x}$ is more or less our approximation of $x$; this makes sense. But if the standard deviation is large (i.e. we see lots of variation in the sampled measurements) then we widen the interval. Conversely, if we sample many data points (i.e. if $n$ is large) then we shrink the interval (because we divide by $\\sqrt{n}$); again this make sense, as the more we sample the more we expect to get a good idea of the quantity we want to approximate. What is nice is that all these ideas combine into a quite simple formula, thanks to the z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** <br> \n",
    "Engineers are concerned with designing devices operated by workers to achieve high productivity and comfort. The paper [Studies on Ergonomically Designed Alphanumeric Keyboards (1985)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4018810/) reports a study of preferred height for a keyboard. A sample of $n=31$ is given and a preferred keyboard height was reported by each of the $31$ sampled typists, with the sample average preferred being $\\overline{x} = 80.0$ cm and the standard deviation being $s=2.0$ cm. Using the steps above, how may we obtain a 95% confidence interval for the real mean - the real preferred height for the population of experienced typists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1. We know $n=31, \\overline{x}=80$, and $s=2$.\n",
    "* Step 2. Since we want a confidence level of 95%, we obtain an associated z-score of $1.96$. \n",
    "* Step 3. Calculating the estimates, we have: $\\overline{x} \\pm 1.96\\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = 80 \\pm (1.96)\\frac{2.0}{\\sqrt{31}} = 80.0 \\pm 0.7 $. So $x_\\text{low} = 79.3$ and $x_\\text{high} = 80.7$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So our confidence interval is $(79.3,80.7)$ and the confidence level of this interval (the probability it contains the mean preferred height for the population of experienced typists) is 95%. we can observe that the interval is quite narrow, thanks to the small standard deviation and the large value of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Margin of error.\n",
    "Last we introduce the notion of margin of error:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <font color=\"black\"><i>Definition:</i> <b>Margin of Error.</b> In a confidence interval, we define the value $z\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$ to be the $\\textbf{margin of error}$ of the confidence interval.</font>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can see that actually the margin of error is nothing else that the half-size of the interval, based on the standard deviation, the sample size and the z-score associated to the confidence level. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly how you should understand the notion of margin of error that we see in many opinion polls: they have polled a sample of $n$ people, chosen a confidence level, computed the corresponding confidence interval and report the centre value $\\overline{x}$ and the half-size of the interval as margin of error."

    "**Try it for yourself!**\n",

    "The interactive tool below generates a plot with the ability to select the parameters of the distribution of the data, as well as the confidence interval for which you hope to find the mean. The red intervals contain the mean, within a confidence interval equal to that selected with the slider. With this tool you can appreciate visually how increasing the number of samples impacts positively the likelihood that the confidence intervals actually contain the mean height. It also shows the effect of having datasets with larger (and smaller) values for mean, and standard deviation."

    "According to an Opinion Article in the National Post [Ontario Teachers Are Overpaid](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/allan-richarz-ontarios-teachers-are-overpaid), the article states that \"Ontario’s Sunshine List of public-sector employees making over \\\\$100,000 each year. Thousands of elementary and secondary school teachers, admin and staff make the list; with some teachers reaching as high as \\\\$133,000 annually\" and the article argues that \"teachers in the province are overpaid; the work is not that onerous nor specialized and the hours not too taxing.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "However, looking at the high school teacher salary in Ontario as reported on [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=High_School_Teacher/Salary/004c9fd6/Toronto-ON), shows that these teacher may not necessarily be overpaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "It matters first as to which group of workers we are looking at in the industry for instance, some employees such as school administrators make more than the average secondary school teachers and can drag the average salary up.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also matters to look at how long they have been working in the industry. A count of 61 entry level teachers (working for 0-5 years) reported an income of \\\\$52,000 a year and a count of 44 mid-career level teachers (working for 5-10 years) reported an income of \\\\$56,000 a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not until we get to the count of 33 experienced teachers (working for 10-15 years) reporting an income of \\\\$75,000 a year and late career teachers (working for 15-20 years) reporting an income of \\\\$88,000 that we see comparable incomes as reported by the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately we cannot obtain a confidence interval, as the individual data values in the data set are not provided by PayScale."
