    "* `Inductive reasoning` involves looking for __patterns__ in evidence in order to come up with conjectures (i.e. things that are likely to be true). This sort of reasoning will __not__ tell you whether or not something actually _is_ true but it is still very useful for making connections and figuring out what to investigate next.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Deductive reasoning` involves starting with what you __know__ and logically figuring out if some conjecture __must__ also be true (and why). While deductive reasoning is stronger than inductive reasoning, it can also be more difficult to use.\n",

Being able to apply these skills will make you a more effective problem solver. Being able to distinguish between the two will help you maintain a clear understanding of what you're doing, why you're doing it, and avoid mistakes in the processs."

Fortunately for us we managed to find a counterexample right away but there are conjectures where the first counterexample took decades to find and required numbers so large that it's virtually impossible for people to find them by hand.

    "In general these sorts of techniques where one performs a computation by manipulating the digits of a value is called an 'algorism' (not to be confused with algorithm). They're not really used very much these days (except for fast mental math gimicks).\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular algorism has a lot of generalizations for dealing with larger numbers but the reasoning behind them gets quite convoluted and in the end the most important part isn't proving that a algorism works for all numbers but that it works for all the numbers for which a mental computation is fast. In this case we can be satisfied by saying that this algorism works for numbers between $91$ and $109$ since those values are the easiest to use in practice."

    "Fractions can be difficult to manipulate. Perhaps we can use deductive reasoning to come up with some easier ways to manipulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "First some observations:\n",
    "1. Every number $a$ can be written in fraction form: $$ a=\\frac{a}{1}. $$\n",
    "2. For every number $a$, except in the case where $a=0$, we can write: $$ 1=\\frac{a}{a}. $$\n",
    "3. Multiplying two fractions just multiplies the numerators and denominators: $$ \\left( \\frac{a}{b}\\right) \\left( \\frac{c}{d} \\right) = \\frac{ac}{bd}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to note is that observation (3) gives us a way to factor any fraction: $$ \\frac{a}{b} = \\left( \\frac{a}{1}\\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{b} \\right). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Cancellation follows from these observations as well: $$ (b) \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{b}{1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{a}{1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{b}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{b}{b}\\right) \\left(\\frac{a}{1}\\right) = (1)(a) = a$$\n",

    "### Distributive Property\n",
    "\n",
    "The distributive property is extremely useful in simplifying expressions and performing computations. In fact, every multiplication algorithm you encounter will at some level boil down to some clever application of the distributive property. Simply put the distributive property tells us how addition and multiplication interact: $$(a+b)c = ac + bc.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since multiplication is commutative this statement is equivalent: $$a(c+d) = ac + ad.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The FOIL mnemonic is just a special case of the distributive property:\n",
    "$$ (a+b)(c+d) = (a+b)c + (a+b)d = ac + bc + ad + bd. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that the distributive property can be read two ways. In one sense it tells us how to distribute multiplication accross addition but in another sense it tells us how to undo that distribution. For example, suppose you have something like $6x + 10xy$. If we notice that both $6x$ and $10xy$ have $2x$ as a factor then we can rewrite that as $6x + 10xy = 2x(3 + 5y)$. This technique is an extremely useful application of deductive reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mentally Computing Simple Percentages\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many occasions where one might be asked to compute a percentage of some value on the spot (eg. tipping at a restaurant). Fortunately there's a trick to doing it quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "First notice that computing $10\\%$ is as easy as moving the decimal point one digit to the left (eg. $10\\%$ of $25.3$ is $2.53$). Similarly, $1\\%$ can be computed by moving the decimal point two digits to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there on it's just a matter of adding, subtracting, and/or multiplying these percentages to get to the desired percentage. For instance, $18\\%$ can be computed by first computing $10\\%$, doubling the value to get $20\\%$, moving the decimal over one more time to get $2\\%$ and then subtracting the $2\\%$ value from the $20\\%$ value. It's easier than it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an application of deductive reasoning because we reached all of the assertions here logically, not by looking at any patterns and conjecturing."
