            "explaination": "First we start with how many combinations there are to make a group of all boys. We have 7 boys and groups of 3 so we have $_7C_3$. Next we divide by how many different combinations there are when we include all 12 students. Therefore, we get $\\frac{_7C_3}{_{12}C_3}$."

            "explaination": "If we spin a wheel, and then spin a wheel a second time, the first spin does not affect the result of the second spin, therefore, spinning the wheel is an Independent event."

            "explaination": "Since there are 3 face cards in a deck (King, Queen, Jack) and 4 suits, we know that there are 12 face cards in total in a deck. Therefore, the probability of pulling a face card is $\\frac{12}{52} = \\frac{4}{13}$. The probability of rolling a 6 with a fair die is $\\frac{1}{6}$.

            "explaination": "First we determine what the probability of pulling a red card is. We know that half a deck is red and the other half is black. Therefore, the probability of pulling a red card is $\\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of pulling a face card, as we have seen before, is $\\frac{3}{13}$. Since this is a $union$ question, we need to also minus the $intersection$ of these two events. Therefore, we get: "
