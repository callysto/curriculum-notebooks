    "\n",
    "* What is the probability of a lotto 6/49 ticket winning the lottery?\n",
    "* How many ways can we arrange seating in a restaurant?\n",

    "A combination is much like a permutation, except now we consider sets where the order does not matter. What does that mean? Well, if we have a set of circles where the colors are { $ Green, Red, Blue$ } and another set { $ Red, Green, Blue $ } we say that these sets have the same *combination* of elements and are therefore the same. Below we have Pascal's triangle, where the a number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. You can highlight the numbers added together by hovering over a particular number. We will see why this is related to combinations in the next section."

The permuations formula will not be enough to consider this scenario. We need to think about how to eliminate the double counting of sets that contain the same elements. Going back to permutations again, how many different ways are there to arrange $r$ unique elements? Well we know that there are $r!$ to arrange the elements in the set of $r$ unique elements. Therefore, we can use this knowledge to modify the permutations formula by dividing adding $r!$ to the denominator, meaning we also divide by the number of different ways we can arrange $r$ elements, and we get the number of combinations within the set. This formula is known as the **Binomial Coefficient**: \n",

Well, if we are only getting numbers from the range of 1-49, then we have 49 numbers to choose from. How many numbers are we choosing?

    "## Compound Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to know the probability of certain events happening such as what is the probability of flipping a coin twice and it comes out heads both times. There are two types of events:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Independent**: An event is independent if any other event does not affect it's outcome.\n",
    "* **Dependent**: An event is dependent if the result of another event has an inpact on the events outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well let's think about what might be an independent event. If you flip a coin twice, does the result of the first flip have any affect on the second flip? The answer is no. Therefore, flipping a coin in this circumstance is an **independent** event. Now lets look at a deck of cards. If I ask you what is the probability of pulling two aces out of a deck, what do you think the probability is if you do not put the first card back into the deck? Well, a deck has 52 cards and 4 aces. Therefore, the first time I pick a card, the probability of me choosing an ace is $\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}$. When I pick an ace with my first choice, what happens to the probability of picking the second ace? Well, there is one less card in the deck and there is once less ace to choose from the deck. Therefore, the probability of choosing the second ace becomes $\\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{17}$. We then multiply these events together to get the probability of drawing two aces:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{13} * \\frac{1}{17} = \\frac{1}{221}$ or $0.4524\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a **dependent** event. When we are looking at an event dealing with probability, the notation we use is $P(A)$ where A is the event we are considering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the probability of an event a little more. What if we are to determine the probability of getting a heads and then pulling a 2 spades from a deck of 52 cards (and the card does not go back). This is what is called an *intersection of events* ($A \\cap B$). Alright, lets think about this one step at a time. Let's mark each event with a letter. We will say that the event of flipping a coin and getting a heads is $A$ and the probability ($P(A)$) of that event is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Now the second event, pulling two spades, is a **dependent** event and we will call it $B$. The probability of $B$ ($P(B)$) is $\\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}$ for the first card and since we do not put that card back, it is $\\frac{12}{51} = \\frac{4}{17}$ for the second card. Now we multiply these events together to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(B) = \\frac{1}{13} * \\frac{4}{17} = \\frac{4}{221}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have compound events, we then multiply their probability together:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) * P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{4}{221} = \\frac{4}{442}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at another question. If you were to roll two 6-sided die, what is the probability of getting a number which is even or divisible by 4? Well, since we are looking at rolling two 6 sided die, the numbers we can get are ${2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}$. From those we can see that ${2,4,6,8,10,12}$ are the even numbers and ${4,8,12}$ are the numbers which are divisible by 4. Notice anything? If we were to take the probability of either event happening, we would be double counting, since the set of numbers that are divisible by 4 are in the set of numbers which are even. We account for this in the *Union of events* which we express as $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B )$ which reads *the probability of A or B is equal to the probability of event A plus the probablility of event B minus the probability of event A and event B*. The probability of rolling a number which is even is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of getting a number which is divisible by 4 is $\\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Now we need to multiply these probabilities to get $P(A \\cap B)$. Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we calculate the union,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A \\cup B) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the chance of rolling an even number or a number that is divisible by 4 is $\\frac{5}{8}$"

    "## Odds\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will explore the odds of an event happening and questions you may hear regarding odds. Odds are usually given in the form $a$:$b$ where $b$ is the the amount it will succeed and $a$ being the amount it will fail. You then total your numbers ($a + b$) to get the total number to divide by, and you get $\\frac{b}{a+b}$ chance of the event happening or $\\frac{a}{a+b}$ chance of the event failing. Let's look at a few examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the odds of winning the lottery are 99:1 then you have a $\\frac{1}{99+1} = \\frac{1}{100} = 1\\%$\n",
    "* The odds of flipping a coin and getting a heads are 1:1 ($\\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2} = 50\\%$)\n",
    "* The odds of rolling a die and getting either a 5 or a 6 are 4:2 or 2:1 ($\\frac{1}{2+1} = \\frac{1}{3} = 33.33\\%$)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this can be confusing sometimes when we see sports bets. However, if we look at the math, it makes sense. Usually we see things like 99:1 odds. This means that the event is unlikely ($\\frac{1}{100} = 1\\%$), so the bookie is willing to pay you out 99 dollars for every dollar you put into the pool. For instance, at 99:1 odds if you were to put in a 2 dollar bet and won, you would receive 198 dollars ($99 * 2$). Not too bad, hey? However, odds are never really this high unless the event is very unlikely to happen.\n",
