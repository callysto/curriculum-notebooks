    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We are almost done: we now have the ratio represented as a value between 0 and 1. To finish getting the answer to our problem all we need to do is multiply this value by $100$ to get our percentage. $$0.88 \\times 100 = 88\\%$$\n",

    "Putting it all together we can say $22$ is $88\\%$ of $25$.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in this notebook, percentages show up in many different ways and are very useful when describing a ratio. It allows for demonstrating any ratio on a familiar scale ($100$) to make data easier to understand. In this notebook we covered the following: \n",
    "- A percentage simply represents a fraction\n",
    "- To convert any fraction to a percent we turn it into it's decimal form and add $100$\n",
    "- A percentage of an amount is simply a fraction multiplication problem\n",
    "- To add or subtract a percentage of an amount we first find the percent value than add/subtract from the original value\n",
    "- When adding a percentage to an amount we an use the decimal form of percent and add $1$ to it (for example $\\$12\\times(0.05+1)=\\$12.60$)\n",
    " \n",
    " Keep practising converting fractions to percentages and it will eventually become second nature!"
