But before we can do that, we will first learn what the following two mathematical terms mean: _probability_ and _odds_. Both of these words are used to describe the likeliness of an event to occur. In casual conversations, they are sometimes used to mean the same thing - however, we will learn that they are not equivalent in terms of formal mathematical definitions.\n",

    "This notebook begins with two separate sections, one for odds and one for probabilities. At the start of each, we will first learn the relevant definitions and concepts as to what these terms mean, and examples for how we may think about them. Once we understand the language of odds and probabilities, we will then look at how they are related, and how we may express one as the other. We will also look at how they are used in the media, and how we can determine the odds for and and against an outcome in a situation.\n",

    "### Making Decisions Based on Odds & Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "One topic where we may hear periodically in the news with regards to the usage of the words odds and probability is that of lottery winners. According to CBC, approximately a quarter of Canadians play the lottery weekly. We can buy a ticket and choose three sets of seven numbers for $5.00 for a chance to become a millionaire. Now how do we calculate the odds of and probability of winning? \n",
    "\n",
    "For an example, let us consider [Lotto Max](http://lotto.bclc.com/lotto-max-and-extra/prizes-and-odds.html). In this lottery game, the player is to select 7 distinct numbers from 1 to 49. We can count the number of ways to do this by using the _Choose Function_ (mathematically known as [Binomial Coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient)), which gives the number of ways to choose $k$ non-ordered elements from a fixed set of $n$ elements, which we write as follows: \n",
    "$${n \\choose k} = {n! \\over {k!(n-k)!}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ and $k$ are both positive integers and $n!$ means $n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdots 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1$ (it's simply some positive integer $n$ and multiplied by every positive integer less than it. Now, back to the lottery, we have $k=7$ numbers to choose from a total of $n=49$ numbers. The number of ways to do this is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${49 \\choose 7} = {49! \\over {7!(49-7)!}} = {49! \\over {7!42!}} = {49\\cdot 48\\cdot 47\\cdot 46\\cdot 45\\cdot 44\\cdot 43\\cdot 42! \\over {7!42!}} = {49\\cdot 48\\cdot 47\\cdot 46\\cdot 45\\cdot 44\\cdot 43 \\over {7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1}} = 85,900,584$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to win the lottery, we must hold a winning ticket where one of the sets of numbers we chose matches all 7 of the winning numbers - and we note that there is exactly only one set of such winning numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a $5.00 ticket allows us to choose three sets of seven numbers, our chances of winning are slightly better (assuming that we don't choose exactly the same seven numbers for two or three of our sets). So we have three of the possible 85,900,584 seven number configurations, which makes the odds for holding a winning ticket as 3:85,900,584 or 1:28,633,528.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploration.** Every ticket comes with three sets of seven numbers we can choose from. We saw that the odds of having a ticket with winning numbers is 3:85,900,584 (or 1:28,633,528 simplified), if we suppose that we had only one set of seven numbers to choose from in a single ticket, the odds of winning would be much lower -  1:85,900,584. So in comparing having one set of number to that of seven numbers, our chances seems to have improved. \n",
