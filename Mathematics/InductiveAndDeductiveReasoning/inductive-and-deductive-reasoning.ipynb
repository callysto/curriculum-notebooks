    "1. Any integer, like $3$, can be written in fraction form: $$ 3=\\frac{3}{1}. $$\n",
    "2. Any integer except $0$, like $3$, can be put into a fraction to get $1$: $$ 1=\\frac{3}{3}. $$\n",
    "3. In order to multiply two fractions, such as $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{5}{7}$, just multiply the numerators and denominators: $$ \\left( \\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right) = \\frac{(2)(5)}{(3)(7)} = \\frac{10}{21}. $$\n",

    "\n",
    "The distributive property is extremely useful in simplifying expressions and performing computations. In fact, every multiplication algorithm you encounter will at some level boil down to some clever application of the distributive property. Simply put the distributive property tells us how addition and multiplication interact: $$(a+b)c = ac + bc.$$\n",

    "If we notice that both $6x$ and $10xy$ have $2x$ as a factor, since $6x=2x(3)$ and $10xy=2x(5y)$, then we can rewrite that as $$6x + 10xy = 2x(3 + 5y).$$\n",

    "\n",
    "From there on it's just a matter of adding, subtracting, and/or multiplying these percentages to get to the desired percentage. For instance, $18\\%$ can be computed by first computing $10\\%$, doubling the value to get $20\\%$, moving the decimal over one more time to get $2\\%$ and then subtracting the $2\\%$ value from the $20\\%$ value. It's easier than it sounds.\n",
