    "Logarithms are the inverse operation to exponentials. They are useful because they change the arithmetic operations of multiplication, division, and powers into addition, subtraction, and products. While modern calculators can do all these operations quickly, for us mere humans logarithms can be useful for doing quick approximations in our heads."

    "\n",
    "Going about our day, we often run into powers of ten, when we see kilograms of food in a grocery store (1000 grams), megawatts of power from an electrical generator (1,000,000 watts) or gigabytes of memory in our computer (1,000,000,000 bytes). It is the **power** of ten that is important, and the logarithm captures this idea with the formulas\n",

    "$$ \\log(1,000,000) = 6$$\n",

    "The logarithm of a number $x$ is defined as the power $n$ it takes so that $$x = 10^n.$$ So, for instance, since $1000 = 10^3$, we know that $\\log(1000) = 3,$ as indicated in the list above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For numbers that aren't integer powers of 10, the logarithm is still defined by the above formula, where $n$ can be any real number solving $x = 10^n$. For instance, you might guess that $\\log(5000)$ is somewhere between 3 and 4, since the number 5000 is halfway between $10^3 = 1000$ and $10^4 = 10,000$. You might even guess that $\\log(5000) = 3.5$, which is not a bad approximation: in fact, a calculator shows that\n",
