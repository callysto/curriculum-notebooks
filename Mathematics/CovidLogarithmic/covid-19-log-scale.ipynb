    "\n",
    "Charts with logarithmic scales can help show how fast the number of cases is increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that on a logarithmic scale, $y$ values increase by a set factor. However estimating a factor (the average number of new infections deriving from an existing infection) in this scenario is challenging for a number of reasons, some of which are outlined in the article [Why R0 Is Problematic for Predicting COVID-19 Spread](https://www.the-scientist.com/features/why-r0-is-problematic-for-predicting-covid-19-spread-67690).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we don't have the factor at which the function increases, the logarithmic scale is a great way to measure the rates of change of new confirmed infections. When we use a logarithmic scale for COVID-19 confirmed cases, we can see when the exponential growth of infections starts to level off."
