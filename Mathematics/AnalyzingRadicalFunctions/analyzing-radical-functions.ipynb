    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook will cover the basics of analyzing and graphing radical functions. Specifically we will look closely at the square root function, which is the most common type, as well as other forms of radical functions. The most important aspect of radical functions is to understand where the function *exists*, which is often called the *domain of existence* and this will be explored further as you go through the notebook. Looking at rational functions will incorporate aspects of intervals and inequalities, as well as finding the roots of quadratic equations."

    "## Radical Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Radical functions are defined as any function that is contained within a \"radical\", which simply tells us that some \n",
    "function $g(x)$ is contained within a fractional exponent. This can be written as\n",
    "$f(g(x)) = g(x)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$\n",
    "where $n$ is a nonzero integer. So what does $g(x)$ look like? Well it can take on any form! Let's look at a few examples for different $g(x)$ functions.\n",
    "1. $g(x) = x$ $\\ \\ $ $\\color{red}\\rightarrow$ $\\ \\ $ $f(g(x)) = x^{\\frac{1}{n}}$\n",
    "2. $g(x) = x^2 + 2x$ $\\ \\ $ $\\color{red}\\rightarrow$ $\\ \\ $ $f(g(x)) = (x^2 + 2x)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$\n",
    "3. $g(x) = \\frac{x^3 - 9x + 3}{2x - 1}$ $\\ \\ $  $\\color{red}\\rightarrow$ $\\ \\ $  $f(g(x)) = \\Big(\\frac{x^3 - 9x + 3}{2x - 1}\\Big)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the most common type of radical function and the one you have likely encountered the most often, is the square root function $\\sqrt{x}$. This is equivalent to writing $x^{\\frac{1}{2}}$. So if we wanted to obtain the *square root* of some \n",
    "function $f(x)$, this is done so by simply doing \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\big[ \\ f(x) \\ \\big]^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{f(x)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we think about root finding, understanding how radicals work is an important step to finding where a function\n",
    "$f(x) = 0$. If we look at only quadratic functions of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$\n",

    "there are many cases where the roots of this function can be found immediately by taking the square root. However, remember that when you take the square root of a single value, such as $4$, we get the result of \n",

    "So what exactly is happening here? Well, as you may have noticed all the triangles that form this design are right angle triangles. Starting from the innermost triangle, you can see that it has two side lengths equal to 1 with a hypotenuse equal to $\\sqrt{2}$. Moving onwards from that, the next triangle is again a right angle triangle, just rotated now by some angle $\\phi$. It now has a base length equal to $\\sqrt{2}$, a hypotenuse equal to $\\sqrt{3}$ and the remaining side remains to be 1. Can you see the pattern here ? Each of the $n^{\\rm th}$ triangle has it's outermost side length fixed at 1, where the base and the hypotenuse are $\\sqrt{n}$ and $\\sqrt{n+1}$ respectively for $n > 0$. \n",

    "$\\phi = \\arctan\\Big(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\Big)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "for the $n^{\\rm th}$ triangle. This is true because $\\tan\\phi = \\frac{\\rm opposite}{\\rm adjacent}$ and our side opposite $\\phi$ is fixed at length 1 and the adjacent side changes to $\\sqrt{n}$ for the $n^{\\rm th}$ triangle. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these simple facts, one can construct a code that creates this fun visual application of square roots! Feel free to look at ``Spiral_Of_Theodorus.py`` to see how the spiral was created. Below is an interactive widget where you can change how many triangles are formed in the spiral. \n",
