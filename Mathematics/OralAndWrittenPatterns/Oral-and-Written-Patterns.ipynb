How can we think of this as a pattern? Well to start let's say it has just one head, after hercules removes this head, now there are two in it's place. Next there is three heads, then four heads, and so on!  For this example, let's break it down at look at some small cases first. \n",

Then if we wanted to know how many heads the hydra had after 25 cuts we can know right away without counting from 1 cut up to 25 cuts.\n",

The rule for the fibonacci sequence is a bit more complex than the previous sequences we've looked at, as it's not increasing by a constant or a constant ratio. Instead, to get the next term in the sequence, we add the previous two terms together. Here's the rule expressed mathematically:\n",

    "What did you learn about patterns in this notebook? We discussed the concepts of arithemtic and geometric sequences, and more patterns found in real life. We learned ways to concisely express complicated patterns using simple language and mathematics. Here is a brief review of the terms and concepts we touched on:\n",
