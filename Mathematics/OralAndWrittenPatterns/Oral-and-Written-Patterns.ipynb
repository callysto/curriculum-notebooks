How can we think of this as a pattern? Well to start let's say it has just one head, after hercules removes this head, now there are two in it's place. Next there is three heads, then four heads, and so on!  For this example, let's break it down at look at some small cases first. \n",

Then if we wanted to know how many heads the hydra had after 25 cuts we can know right away without counting from 1 cut up to 25 cuts.\n",

Keep reading to find out how we figured out this rule. remember that n always will start at 1, and increment from there. Remember we start at the first term, so that means n=1."

So for example, the common ratio of this sequence is $2$.\n",

    "We have just scratched the surface of patterns. While arithmetric and geometric sequences are quite useful, there are also other unique patterns which are quite interesting to look at. One of the most famous patterns is called the Fibonacci Sequence. We can find examples of it all throughout nature. That green gif at the beginning of this notebook is a Romanesco Broccoli, and the number of spirals on one head is a fibonacci number. A **fibonacci number** is any number which appears in the fibonacci sequence. More locally, the fibonacci sequence arises if we look at the cones of a pine tree. The rule for the fibonacci sequence is a bit more complex than the previous sequences we've looked at, as it's not increasing by a constant or a constant ratio. Instead, to get the next term in the sequence, we add the previous two terms together. Here's the rule expressed mathematically:\n",

This also can be interpreted as a square with side length n. We can also visualize it as dots on a grid, and the square of n is how many dots are in the square with n dots as a side. \n",

    "At first you may think perhaps at some point there should be a fraction since we're dividing by 2. However the whole numbers alternate between odd and even, so that means between $n$ and $(n+1)$ in the numerator, one of these terms *must* be even so there will be a cancellation possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule for the triangle numbers arises in many places, for example if you wanted to build a house of cards, or determine how many logs are in a triangular stack, you could save a lot of headache by using the rule and counting the side length instead of counting up every individual piece."

We learned ways to concisely express complicated patterns using simple language and mathematics. Here is a brief review of the terms and concepts we touched on:\n",
