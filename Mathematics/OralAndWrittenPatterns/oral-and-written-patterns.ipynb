    "# Understanding Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns appear all around us in everyday life and in nature. One of the fun parts of math is discovering how we can use it to understand the world around us.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to look at patterns that we can describe using numbers. All of the patterns we will look at today are called **sequences**, where there is an ordering to the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider how the alphabet has the ordering: A, B, C, D, and so on. A is the *first* item in our sequence, and Z is the *last* item in our sequence. Not all sequences have an end, some of them keep going and going!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another simple sequence is the positive number line, where the *next number* is the *previous number* plus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Alphabet as a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to represent the sequence of letters in the alphabet, we could use $n$ to represent when the term appears in the sequence, and $x$ to represent the term itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|$n$|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|25|26|\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|$x$|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Greek mythology, there is a tale where Hercules has to fight a three headed [Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra), which has the ability to regrow its heads. Everytime the Hydra loses a head, *two* grow in its place! \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we think of this as a pattern? The Hydra has three heads, and after Hercules removes one there are two in its place, for a total of four heads. Removing one of those heads results in two more growing back, for a total of five heads, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **rule** for the hydra pattern lets us accurately describe a sequence in a formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_n = n + 3 $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the number of heads, $n$ is the number of cuts made, and the $n^{th}$ number ($x_n$) in the pattern is equal to $n + 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if we want to know how many heads the hydra has after 25 cuts, we can know right away without counting from 1 to 25 cuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetic Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've talked about what a **rule** is, let's look at types of sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arithmetic Sequences** increase by a fixed number which we call the **difference**, since it is the difference between two terms in a row of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "An arithmetic sequence on a number line:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/arithmetic-sequence.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "|$n$|1|2|3|4|5|6|\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|$x$|1|3|5|7|9|11|\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the difference is $2$ and the starting value is $1$, the rule for this arithmetic sequence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_n = 2n -1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a rule for an arithmetic sequence has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_n = a(n-1) + b $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is the difference, $b$ is the first value, and $n$ is the step.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Geometric Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Sequences** can increase very quickly compared to arithmetic sequences. To get the next term in a geometric sequence, we **multiply** the previous term by a number instead of adding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/geometric-sequence.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "|$n$|1|2|3|4|5|6|\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|$x$|1|2|4|8|16|32|\n",
    "\n",
    "Each $x$ is double the previous one, so the **common ratio** for this sequence is $2$. The term **common ratio** refers to the simplified ratio of any two consecutive terms, $2:1$ in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the 5th term in this sequence, it would have to be doubled 4 times from the first term:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{1st term} * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = \\text{5th term}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponents** give us an easier way to represent this, $2*2*2*2 = 2^4$. Sometimes, people would say this is \"two raised to the power of 4\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Using exponents, we can express the fifth term as the first term times $2^4$. Remember, because the first term hasn't been doubled yet, we only want to raise 2 to the power of 4, **not** 5. So the pattern rule is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_n = 2^{n-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "See how we're raising 2 to the power of $n - 1$? That's because the first term hasn't been doubled yet. For the first term:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_1 = 2^{1-1} = 2^{0} = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you haven't encountered 0 powers yet, just remember that any number to the power of $0$ is equal to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any geometric sequence can be describe using the exponents rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_n = ar^{n-1}$\n",

    "We have just scratched the surface of patterns. While arithmetic and geometric sequences are quite useful, there are also other unique and interesting patterns. One of the most famous patterns is called the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). The rule for the Fibonacci sequence is a bit more complex than the previous sequences we've looked at, as it's not increasing by a constant number or a constant ratio. Instead, to get the next term in the sequence, we add the previous two terms together. Here's the rule expressed mathematically:\n",

    "### Square Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other interesting patterns we can find in real life and model using rules. For example, you may have heard of the square of a number. The square is $n^2 = n * n$. This can also be interpreted as a square with side length of $n$ or visualized as dots on a grid:\n",

    "What if instead of drawing squares, we wanted to draw triangles?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/triangle-numbers.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule for the triangle numbers is a little trickier than for the square numbers. Realize that just as in the square numbers, $n$ is the side length of the triangle. It is as follows:\n",

    "In this notebook, we discussed the concepts of arithmetic sequences, geometric sequences, and more patterns found in real life. We learned ways to concisely express complicated patterns using simple language and mathematics.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Arithmetic sequences** increase by a fixed amount between terms, this fixed amount is called the **difference**.\n",

    "The standard rule for arithmetic sequences is:\n",

    "$ x_n = an + b $\n",
    "\n",
