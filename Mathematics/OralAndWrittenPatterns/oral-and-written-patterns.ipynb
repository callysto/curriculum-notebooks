    "\n",
    "Today we're going to look at patterns that we can describe using numbers. All of the patterns we're going to talk about today are called **sequences**, where there is an ordering to the pattern. Consider how the alphabet has the ordering: A, B, C, D, and so on. A is the *first* item in our sequence, and Z is the *last* element in our sequence. Not all sequences have an end, some of then keep going, and going, and going! Another simple sequence is the positive number line, where the next number is the previous number plus one.\n",

    "## Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Greek mythology, there is a tale where the hero Hercules has to fight a three headed [Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra), which has the ability to regrow its heads after they've been severed. The feat quickly becomes much harder than it originally looks, as everytime the Hydra loses a head, *TWO* grow in its place! \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we think of this as a pattern? To start, let's say the Hydra has just one head, and after Hercules removes this head, there are now two in its place, for a total of three heads. Removing one of those heads results in two more growing back, for a total of four heads, and so on!  For this example, let's break it down at look at some small cases first. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first number in the pattern: **3**  (the number of heads the hydra has to start)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second number in the pattern: **4** (after one head is cut off)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The third number in the pattern: **5** (after another head is removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The fourth number in the pattern: **6** (another one)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this sound familiar? That's because the **rule** for the hydra pattern is the similar to the number line we saw above. A rule lets us accurately describe a sequence in a formula. We call it a rule because every item in our sequence will follow the rule. We want to try and make a rule as simple as possible. Then if we wanted to know how many heads the hydra had after 25 cuts we can know right away without counting from 1 cut up to 25 cuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about it in words, first we have the amount from the previous step, then we take away one head which hercules chose to cut off, and then we add two heads which grow in its place. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to write it as a rule, we can do it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_n = n + 3 $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the number of heads, and $n$ is the number of cuts made by Hercules\n",
    "\n",
    "This is saying the $n^{th}$ number ($x_n$) in the pattern is equal to $n + 3$ because there was initially 3 heads before any were removed (i.e. number of cuts equals 0). Adding a number to $n$ will change the starting point of our sequence. If you're asked to count starting at 1 ($n=1$), or starting at 5 ($n=5$), you count the same way, just starting at a different number! Keep reading to find out how we figured out this rule."

A **Fibonacci number** is any number which appears in the Fibonacci sequence. More locally, the Fibonacci sequence arises if we look at the cones of a pine tree. The rule for the Fibonacci sequence is a bit more complex than the previous sequences we've looked at, as it's not increasing by a constant or a constant ratio. Instead, to get the next term in the sequence, we add the previous two terms together. Here's the rule expressed mathematically:\n",

    "What did you learn about patterns in this notebook? We discussed the concepts of arithmetic and geometric sequences, and more patterns found in real life. We learned ways to concisely express complicated patterns using simple language and mathematics. Here is a brief review of the terms and concepts we touched on:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **rule** describes a sequence or pattern in a concise way, possibly using a formula. To determine the nth term, we would look at the rule for the case of $x_n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **initial value** is another way to say *the first term in the sequence*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arithmetic sequences** increased by a fixed amount between terms, this fixed amount is called the **difference**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard rule for arithmetic sequences is:\n",
    "$ x_n = an + b $\n",
    "Where a is the difference and b is the initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric sequences** increased by a **common ratio** which we can think of as the ratio between two sequential terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard rule for geometric sequences is:\n",
    "$x_n = ar^{n-1}$\n",
    "Where a is the first term in the sequence, and r represents the common ratio of the geometric sequence. "
