    "# Understanding the Relationship Between Two Variables Using Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard the old saying, \"you get what you give\".  It means what you get is worth the same as what you give up for it.  But have you ever noticed that if you *change* what you give, it can *change* what you get?  Like when you eat more food, you get more energy, or when you spend more time on homework, you get better grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, the things you get (or give) are like **variables**—they are amounts that are allowed to change.  Sometimes, changing the value of one variable can affect the value of another.  Think about this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Example  \n",
    "> Say you have a job that pays you 10\\\\$ per hour. The amount of money you earn after working 5 hours depends on this wage (5 hours)x(10\\\\$ per hour) = 50\\\\$. If your wage goes up to 12\\\\$ per hour, the amount of money you would make in 5 hours would change as well (5 hours)x(12\\\\$ per hour) = 60\\\\$. So, your wage is a *variable* that determines how much money you are going to make.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are a part of our lives every day, but their exact effect can be hard to understand on their own.  A useful tool to help us see how variables affect results is called a **graph**, which is simply a visual way to show how variables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will focus on how we can use graphs to improve our understanding of how two variables interact with each other. There are many different types of graphs, but we will focus on line graphs in this lesson to show you how to work with **linear functions**. We will go through:\n",
    "- how to create a graph of a linear function \n",
    "- how to analyze some important features of a graph\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Algebraic Equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the relationship between variables can be written as an **equation**. An equation is like a sentence—it uses an 'equals' sign to connect two expressions, like how a sentence uses a verb to connect a subject and an object.  For example, the relationship between wage and the amount of money made after working for 5 hours, as described above, can be written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\label{1}\n",
    "\\rm MONEY\\: MADE = 5\\: HOURS \\times WAGE\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the same equation, only now it is expressed using **algebra** (with letters in place of the words):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\label{2}\n",
    "M = 5W\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of an **algebraic equation**.  It compresses all the information about the variables into a very small space that's easy to work with. The $W$ corresponds to wage, and the $M$ corresponds to the resulting amount of money made.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an algebraic expression, the letters that you use for variables really doesn't matter. A good choice is to use the first letter of the word (like how we used $M$ for money and $W$ for wage). However, in mathematics, the default letters are $x$ and $y$, especially when a graph will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of the equations you'll see in class, the variables may not have any real-world meaning, but that's okay. Take a look at the examples below—each one is an algebraic equation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">#### **Examples**\n",

    "### **Linear Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "If an equation says a variable is equal to something that doesn't involve that variable, that equation is called a **function**. For example, the equation $y=2x-3$ says that $y$ (a variable) is equal to $2x-3$ (which uses $x$, but not $y$). In this case, we say $y$ is a *function* of $x$.  A **linear function** has the form\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "Take another look at the equations shown in the section above, these are all linear functions! When a linear function is used to create a graph, the graph will look like a straight line (hence the name *linear* function).\n"

The *independent* variable is the one that is allowed to change freely; the *dependent* variable is the one that responds to those changes—in other words, it *depends* on the independent variable. The two variables form an \"if-then\" pair: \"*IF* the independent variable is this, *THEN* the dependent variable must be that.\" The difference between the two types of variables may be difficult to understand at first, so here is an example that may help.\n",
    "***\n",
    ">#### **Example**\n",
    "Let's say you want to measure how many push-ups you can do in a certain amount of time. There are two variables here: the amount of time, and the number of push-ups you do in that time. In this scenario, you are able to freely change how much time you have to do push-ups. You could give yourself 30 seconds, an hour, or a day! Therefore, *time is the independent variable*. \n",
    "But the number of push-ups you are actually able to do *depends* on the amount of time you have to do them. If you give yourself more time, you can do more push-ups.  Therefore, the *dependent variable is the number of push-ups you do*. \n",

    "In this lesson, we have highlighted some of the many ways that a graph can help us understand the relationship between two variables in a linear function. Some of the important methods that you should remember include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining a Linear Function\n",
    "- Identifying the Independent and Dependent Variables\n",
    "- Setting up a Graph on the Cartesian Plane\n",
    "- Creating and Plotting Data Points\n",
    "- Finding the slope of a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout your life, you will be presented with all sorts of statistics, data, charts and graphs. It is important that you have the skills required to analyze what a graph is trying to tell you, not just so you can pass your math class, but to enable you to make informed decisions when you need to consider how different variables can interact and affect results.\n",
