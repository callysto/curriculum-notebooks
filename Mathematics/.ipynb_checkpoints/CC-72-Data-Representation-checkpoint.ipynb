    "Bar graphs can be used in many ways, but they usually show one piece of information collected from many groups or categories. For example, they might show the number of hours worked by people in different age groups, or how many grey shirts each girl in a class owns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some ways to misuse bar graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Make the scale on the graph start above zero.** This makes small differences between bars look much bigger than they really are.\n",
    "2. **Change the width of the bars to make one category look more important.** This gives one bar more area, which looks like more data.\n",
    "3. **Remove the space between the bars** (that's a **histogram**). Histograms are used for a different kind of data set, and so they are read in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a poorly made bar graph.  It shows the total welfare (support money) received by people in the US from 2009 to 2011.  Each year is divided into 4 three-month pieces called **quarters**.\n",

    "![picture](http://mediamatters.org/static/images/item/fnc-an-20120809-welfarechart-2.jpg)\n",

    "What makes this a bad bar graph?\n",
    "1. Their scale starts at 94 million insead of 0.\n",
    "2. The bars are in 3D, making their values harder to read.\n",
    "3. Their y-axis has 8 labels, but there are 10 levels on the graph (including the top and bottom).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whoever made this graph probably wanted the viewer to think welfare in the US is rising faster than it really is.  Now, let's ask ourselves:\n",
    "\n",

    "- How does it look after we make these changes?\n",

    "\n",
    "Also, pictographs often work best to show data with small numbers. If everything can be easily expressed with a simple scale like the one above, then a pictograph might be the right choice to represent the data.\n",

But as a viewer, we don't see just the height—we also see the width. Not only is the second candy corn twice as high, it's also twice as wide, giving it four times the area as the first candy corn.

    "## Let's look at circle graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a circle graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as a pie chart, a circle graph is used to show how a total is split into different groups. The whole pie represents the total, and each slice of the pie represents a different group.  Each slice gets as much of the pie as its group has of the total—the bigger the slice, the more of the total that group represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "![picture](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/pie-chart-movies.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are circle graphs useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "They make it easy to compare group sizes; if there's a biggest or smallest group, that's easy to see, since group sizes are shown as pieces of a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why might people not use circle graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "To be displayed as a circle graph, data must be converted into percentages of the total, then into slices of a circle, which is more work than other graphs need. Plus, it's easy to mess up if the data are not converted properly (or at all). Circle graphs are also hard to draw accurately on paper, since you need a protractor to ensure your angles are correct. Some people might even say that any time a circle graph would do, a bar graph would do better, and that the pie chart below is the only acceptable one.\n",
