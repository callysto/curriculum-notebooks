    "### Numeral systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical terminology, a **_number system_** refers to the type of number being used.<br>\n",
    "Number systems include the integers, the rational numbers (fractions), and real numbers.<br>\n",
    "A [**_numeral system_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) refers to the way we write those numbers down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numeral system we use when we write a number like 3127 is called the *decimal system*.<br>\n",
    "You've gotten so used to using the decimal system that you understand the number 3127 without thinking!<br>\n",
    "Take a moment to remind yourself that the *position* of each digit represents a value: 1, 10, 100, etc.<br>\n",
    "The digit in that position then tells us how many of that quantity we have.<br>\n",
    "In 3127, there are 3 thousands, one hundred, two tens, and seven ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "But our method of expressing numbers is by no means universal.<br>\n",
    "Another numeral system you've probably encountered is that of Roman numerals.<br>\n",
    "The Roman system uses symbols instead of position to represent certain quantities.<br>\n",
    "We count how many times each symbol appears to know how many of that quantity we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Roman numeral system uses I for 1, V for 5, X for 10, C for 100, and D for 1000, among others.<br>\n",
    "In the Roman system, the number 3127 is written as MMMCXXVII:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "3127&=3000+100+20+7\\\\\n",
    "& = \\underbrace{1000+1000+1000}_{\\text{M M M}}+\\underbrace{100}_{\\text{C}}+\\underbrace{10+10}_{\\text{X X}}+\\underbrace{5}_{\\text{V}}+\\underbrace{1+1}_{\\text{I I}}.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the Roman system, there is no symbol for zero: a number like 210 has no ones, so we don't write any.<br>\n",
    "The number 210 is written CCX. Many early numeral systems did not have a zero. <br>\n",
    "The invention (discovery?) of zero is usually credited to India, around the 4th or 5th century.<br>\n",
    "However, zero was also used in [Mayan calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#History).<br>\n",
    "The number zero is an interesting topic in its own right, but it's not the subject of this notebook.<br>\n",
    "If you're curious, you might enjoy this [Scientific American article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/history-of-zero/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary and decimal numbers are two examples of *positional numeral systems*, where the relative placement of digits tells us about the values they represent.<br>\n",
    "One of the earliest examples of a positional system is the remarkable Babylonian [sexagesimal (base-60) system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_numerals). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our numeral system traces its origins back to India and the Middle East, and is known as the [Hindu-Arabic numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system).<br>\n",
    "This is a decimal system, where positions represent powers of 10, and symbols represent numbers from 0 to 9.<br>\n",
    "For example, as we mentioned above, the expression 3127 is convenient shorthand for\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3\\times 1000 + 1\\times 1000 + 2\\times 10 + 7\\times 1.$$\n",
    "\n",

    "When each position represents successive powers of some number, we call that number the *base* of the system.<br>\n",
    "The decimal system uses base 10. The binary system, which is essential to computing, uses base 2.\n",

    "### Why Binary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do computers use binary? First, we might ask: why do we use decimal?<br>\n",
    "We’ve been using decimal so long, you may not have wondered why we chose the base-10 number system for our everyday number needs.<br>\n",

    "'ON' or '1': electricity is flowing (through circuit, gate, transistor, whatever).<br>\n",
    "'OFF' or '0': electricity is not flowing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a computer, everything must be represented as collections of ONs and OFFs. \n",

    "###  Base and Digits in a Positional System\n",
    "\n",
    "The **base** in a positional numeral system like Hindu-Arabic is the number whose powers we represent by the position of the digits in a number.<br>\n",
    "Note that the value of the base is also the number of different symbols we need for digits.<br>\n",
    "For example, the decimal (base-10) system uses 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.<br>\n",
    "In some computer applications (like many WiFi passwords) a hexadecimal (base-16) system is used, with digits \n",

    "> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In $8^{2}$, 8 is the base, and the result is $8 × 8 = 64$.\n",
    "* In $5^{3}$, 5 is the base, and the result is $5 × 5 × 5 = 125$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't really a coincidence, since we use powers of the base to reconstruct numbers from positional notation.<br>\n",
    "The way our notation works is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Position of a digit (read from right to left) tells us which power of the base to use.\n",
    " - The digit in that position tells us what to multiply that power by.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Any integer greater than 1 can be used as a base. (Why can't we use 1?)<br>\n",
    "For a hypothetical \"base-$r$\" system, we would have $r$ symbols to represent the digits, and each position represents a power of $r$.<br>\n",
    "For example, we could imagine a base-26 system with each letter of the alphabet representing a digit.<br>\n",
    "(It's doubtful anyone would want to *use* this system, but we can imagine it!)<br>\n",
    "In this system, the word \"number\" would actually *be* a number!<br>\n",
    "If we assign each letter its place value in the alphabet, we have\n",

    "$$10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.$$\n",
    "Now, we increase the 'tens' digit by 1 again, and reset the 'ones', getting 20.<br>\n",
    "We continue like this until we reach 99, and then we're ready to add a 1 in the 'hundreds' position.<br>\n",
    "When we do, the digits in both the 'tens' and 'ones' positions reset to zero, and then we continue the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting in binary is similar, with two important differences:\n",
    "1. Positions represent powers of 2, not 10: $ 2^0=1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, 2^5 = 32, 2^6=64$, etc.\n",
    "2. Digits are only 0 and 1, so the 'change position and reset to zero' step is a lot more frequent!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we’ve only got those two digits, so as we do in decimal, when we run out of symbols we shift one column to the left, add a 1, and turn all of the digits to the right of that column to 0. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Converting binary to decimal\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, this is straightforward. The digits in binary are called **_bits_**.<br>\n",
    "Each position represents a power of 2. We multiply each power of 2 by the bit in that position, and then add it all up.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "To convert the number 1101 from binary to decimal, we compute as follows:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "1101 &= 1 * 2^{3} + 1 * 2^{2} + 0 * 2^{1} + 1 * 2^{0} \\\\\n",
    "    &= 1*8+1*4+0*2+1*1\\\\\n",
    "    &= 8+4+1\\\\&=13\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Method\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now demonstrate an interactive approach to doing this conversion.<br>\n",
    "Our implementation uses buttons on a computer screen, but you can do this \"in real life\" as well!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstration we start off with a 5 bit number; that is, a 5 digit binary number, which can represent up to 31 in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Represent each binary digit with a single card, so there will be 5 cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mark one side of each card with a power of 2: our five cards will be 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.<br>\n",
    "Mark the other side with a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Arrange the cards to reflect our positional system: Our order is 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The side with the power of 2 represents 1 in binary and the other side represents 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Start with the 0 on each card. Choose a binary number, then flip the cards whose digit is 1.<br>\n",
    "For example, if we chose the number 11001, we flip the 16, the 8, and the 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now to convert to decimal we just add up the numbers showing in the cards!<br>\n",
    "For 11001 we have $16+8+0+0+1=25$, so 11001 in binary is equivalent to 25 in decimal.\n"

    "\n",
    "When we're working with more than one base system at the same time (for example, when converting from decimal to binary) we need a way of specifying what base we're using.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common notation is to place the digits in parentheses, with the base as a subscript.<br>\n",
    "For example, we can write $(10110)_2$ to indicate that we're expressing a number in binary.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets us write equations, like $(10110)_2 = (22)_{10}$, to indicate that we've expressed the same number in two different bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people use notation like $\\mathbf{Bin}\\,10110 = \\mathbf{Dec}\\, 22$ instead.<br>\n",
    "This notation is a little clumsier, but it can be used for a [great joke](https://armchairdissident.wordpress.com/2009/04/15/a-long-explanation-of-a-damned-fine-joke/)."

    "In the other direction, our goal is to flip the right cards to add up to a given number.<br>\n",
    "Let's say we want the binary representation for 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could simply employ trial and error, flipping cards and checking each time to see if we have it right.<br>\n",
    "This isn't very efficient though. Instead, let's think like a computer scientist, and devise an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we definitely don't want to add any numbers *greater* than our number. So 16 is out: we set that card to 0.\n",
    "2. Next, we're going to want the biggest power of 2 that's *less* than our number. So 8 is in: we set that card to 1.\n",
    "3. Now we ask ourselves, what do we have left to add? This is a subtraction problem! We want 13 and we have 8, so we still have $13-8=5$ left to add.\n",
    "4. To continue, we take the value that's left -- 5 -- and repeat steps 2 and 3. Since 4 is less than 5, we flip that card to 1, and find the difference: $5-4=1$.\n",
    "5. We keep repeating, until there's nothing left to add. But all we have left is 1, so we flip that card, and we're done!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** the steps we just described give an example of what's called a *recursive algorithm*.<br>\n",
    "In a recursive algorithm, we repeat a series of steps until a desired goal is reached.<br>\n",
