We will discuss the importance of the *base* of a numeral system, and how that affects the choice of *digits* used to express a number.

    "A [numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) refers to a convention for writing down numbers. We're all familiar with the usual decimal system, and can understand the meaning of an expression such as 3127. But this method of expressing numbers is by no means universal! Another numeral system you've probably encountered is that of Roman numerals. There are many systems, like the Roman one, that rely on different symbols for certain quantities, and count based on the number of each symbol present. For example, the Roman numeral system uses I for 1, V for 5, X for 10, C for 100, and D for 1000, among others. In the Roman system, the number 3127 is written as MMMCXXVII:\n",

    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the Roman system, there is no symbol for zero: a number like 210 has no ones, so we don't write any: 210 is written CCX. Many early numeral systems did not have a zero. The invention (discovery?) of zero is usually attributed to India around the 4th or 5th century, although zero was also used in [Mayan calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#History). The number zero is an interesting topic in its own right, but it's not the subject of this notebook. However, if you're curious, you might enjoy this [Scientific American article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/history-of-zero/).\n",

When each position represents successive powers of some number, we call that number the *base* of the system. The decimal system uses base 10. The binary system, which is essential to computing, uses base 2.\n",

Maybe it’s because we have 10 fingers, or maybe it’s just because the Romans forced it upon their ancient subjugates. Regardless of what led to it, tricks we’ve learned along the way have solidified base-10’s place in our heart; everyone can count by 10s. We even round large numbers to the nearest multiple of 10.

    "\n",
    "The **base** in a positional numeral system like Hindu-Arabic is the number whose powers are encoded by the relative position of the digits in a number. Note that the value of the base is also the number of different digits needed for that numeral system. For example, the decimal (base-10) system uses 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. In some computer applications (like many WiFi passwords) a hexadecimal (base-16) system is used, with digits \n",

    "Of course, we also use \"base\" to refer to the number that gets multiplied when applying an exponent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In $8^{2}$, 8 is the base, and the result is $8 × 8 = 64$\n",
    "* In $5^{3}$, 5 is the base, and the result is $5 × 5 × 5 = 125$\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't really a coincidence, since we use powers of the base to reconstruct numbers from positional notation. The way our notation works is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Position of a digit (read from right to left) tells us which power of the base to use.\n",
    " - The digit in that position tells us what to multiply that power by.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Any integer greater than 1 can be used as a base. (Why can't we use 1?) For a hypothetical \"base-$r$\" system, we would have $r$ symbols to represent the digits, positions would represent powers of $r$. For example, we could imagine a base-26 system with each letter of the alphabet representing a digit. (It's doubtful anyone would want to *use* this system, but we can imagine it!) In this system, the word \"number\" would actually *be* a number! If we assign each letter its place value in the alphabet, we have\n",

    "We can convert a binary number to decimal by multiplying each bit by its place value and summing.\n",

    "#### For Example :\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "1101 = 1 * 2^{3} + 1 * 2^{2} + 0 * 2^{1} + 1 * 2^{0} \\\\\n",
    "\\qquad   = 13\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Method\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstration we start off with a 5 bit number; this means we will represent a 5 digit binary number, which can represent up to 31 in decimal numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lets say we represent each binary digit with a single card, so there will be 5 cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now is the time to mark the cards. We mark the cards with numbers. For five cards 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When marking the cards is done, we arrange the cards to reflect our positional system: the card for 1 should be leftmost and card reperesenting number 16 should be in the rightmost position. Our order is 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now the representation, the side with the numbers represents 1 in binary and other side with no numbers represents 0. That is if it shows the side of the card with numbers then we read them as 1 in binary and 0 for the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. So if we want to represent a chosen number through these cards. For example if we choose 11001, we will represent the numbers using the cards as told in step 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now comes the fun part in order to convert this binary number chosen (11001) to decimal we just count the number showing in the cards. For this 16+8+0+0+1=25 so (11001) binary numbers is equivalent to 25 in decimal.\n",
