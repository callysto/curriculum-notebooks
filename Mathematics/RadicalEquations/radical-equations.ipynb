    " * Determine when an equation is a radical equation.\n",
    " * Determine  restrictions on the variable in a radical equation.\n",
    " * Explain and use the necessary steps to solve a radical equation.\n",
    " * Be able to find, and explain, the concept of extraneous roots.\n",
    " * Solve word problems with a radical equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A **radical equation** is *an equation in which a variable is under a radical*. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the following *is a radical equation*, because the variable is inside a square root:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x} -5= 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But, the following *is not a radical equation*, because there is no variable inside the radical:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{2} -x= 3,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we will learn the strategy to solve  **radical equations**. We will focus only on radicals which are square roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind this strategy is that we can \"*get rid*\" of a square root by raising the radical to the power of two. We can solve an equation that contains a radical expression by first isolating the radical on one side of the equation. Then, we square both sides of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3\\sqrt{x} = 9.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to isolate the radical expression. Dividing both sides by $3$ gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x} = 3.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)^2 = (3)^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 9$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, when solving radical equations things are not always this easy. Throughout this notebook, we will learn how to deal with more complicated cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start solving equations, we must *keep in mind the following rules*:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Square sides, Not terms\n",
    "\n",
    "> We said that when we are solving a radical equation, we want to eliminate the square root. We can do this by *raising it to the power of two*. \n",
    "When solving an equation, we must apply the same operation to **both sides** of the equation; in particular, we can't do things to each term in the equation. <br><br>\n",
    "For example, consider:\n",
    "<br><br> \n",
    "$$3+4 =7$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The equation above is a true statement. If we square both sides:\n",
    "<br><br> \n",
    "$$(3+4)^2 =7^2,$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We end up with a **correct statement**:\n",
    "<br><br> \n",
    "$$49=49.$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*But*, if we square term by term:\n",
    "<br><br> \n",
    "$$3^2+4^2=7^2,$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We end up with:\n",
    "<br><br> \n",
    "$$25=49,$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Which is **not true**. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "One of the most common mistakes when solving radical equations is trying to square terms. **Always square sides, not terms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Check Your Answers\n",
    "\n",
    ">We can always check our solution to an equation by plugging the solution back into the original equation. For example,  $x + 2 = 5$ has the solution $x = 3$. We can confirm this solution by plugging it back into the original equation:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x + 2 &= 5\\\\\n",
    "(3) + 2 &= 5\\\\\n",
    "5 &=5\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "One problem with solving radical equations is that we may perform every step correctly, but still end up with an incorrect answer. This is because squaring both sides can sometimes create solutions that never existed before. These kinds of solutions are called **extraneous**. We will learn more about these later in the notebook. <br><br>\n",
    "For now, remember to always check your answers when solving a radical equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restrictions on variables in a radical equation\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving radical equations, we need to decide which values of the solution are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, as long as we work with real numbers, we cannot take the square root of a negative number. So, we need to *ensure that we don't choose a negative value for a variable that we take the square root of*. To avoid this situation, we restrict the set of values a variable can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radical Expressions that Contain a Single Term Radicand\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the simplest case\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that in this case, the variable $x$ is restricted to have only non-negative values. Remember that $0$ *is included* in this set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that our equation has more complicated radicands in it. What's the strategy in these cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the general rule to follow is that the expression under the root sign *cannot be negative*. That is, it must equal zero or any other positive value. So for example, if we have the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{17x} = 6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We must set the expression under the square root to be greater than or equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$17x\\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $x$ gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the $x$ in the radical equation can only take on values greater than or equal to zero. Of course, we still need to solve the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(\\sqrt{17x})^2 &= (6)^2\\\\\n",
    "17x &= 36\\\\ \n",
    "x&=\\frac{36}{17}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the solution $\\frac{36}{17}$ is greater than or equal to zero, our restraint is satisfied. So, $\\frac{36}{17}$ is considered a valid solution to the radical equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the equation $\\sqrt{x -4} = 5$. Again, we need to set the expression under the square root to be greater than or equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x-4\\geq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $x$ gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\geq 4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $x$ in the radical equation can take any number greater than or equal to 4. Now, we solve the radical equation. The radicand is already isolated so we can square both sides right away:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\left(\\sqrt{x -4}\\right)^2 &= (5)^2\\\\\n",
    "x-4 &= 25\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $x$ gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 29$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an acceptable value because $29 \\geq 4$."
