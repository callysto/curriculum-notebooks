    "\n",
    "### What is a line graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "A line graph is a way to represent continuous data, data that is connected in some way, like a change over time. In fact, time is one of the most common variables with a line graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![picture](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/line-graph-example.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are line graphs useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "They show a trend of something changing with a easily viewable line compared to just dots on a graph. They work best when the trend involves the change of one variable (jobs, temperature, debt) with respect to another (usually time).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases it can also be useful to plot multiple lines on one graph, usually using colour to distinguish the different variables. For example, one might plot polling results for different political parties over time, as with this graph from the CBC:\n",
    "\n",
    "![federal polling averages](http://www.cbc.ca/polopoly_fs/1.3265490!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can line graphs go wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common error with these graphs is unlabelled axes. We might know that the line is sloping upwards, but we might not know what is growing or how fast. Many mistakes are also made by not using a consistent scale on an axis, but using consistent ticks to make it appear to be consistent spacing. Like this example:\n",

    "Also know as a pie chart, It represents data as an area based on the percentage of the total amount of data. This is very useful for data that is already given as percentages, but most data can be made into percentages by dividing the section section by the total amount then multiplying by 360 degrees to get the area of the area of the circle that the portion covers.\n",

    "### Why might people not use circle graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "All data must be calculated into percetnages then into areas of a circle, which is more work than most data represetnations require. It is also easy to mess up if they are not converted properly or at all. They are also hard to draw acurately on paper as you need a protractor to ensure your angles are right. Some people might even say that any situation that can have a circle graph, a bar graph would do better and the pie chart below is the only acceptable one.\n",
