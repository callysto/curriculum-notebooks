The constants and variables can be related to each other by addition (or subtraction), multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. In this notebook we will use $P(x)$ denote a general polynomial, and we will only deal with polynomials of a single variable $x$. \n","\n","In general, a polynomial is expressed as:\n","\n","$P(x) = c_0 \\,  + \\,c_1x \\,  + ... +\\,  c_{n-2}x^{n-2} +  c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + c_nx^n = \\sum^n_{k=0}c_kx^k$\n","\n","where $c_k$ are *constant terms*, $x$ is the variable. The largest value of $n$ (i.e. the largest exponent) determines the *degree* of the polynomial. For example, some polynomials of degree *three* could be:\n","\n","$P(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x + 4$\n","\n","$P(x) = 3x^3 + 8x $\n","\n","$P(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 4$\n","\n","Note that only the value of the largest exponent affects the degree of the polynomial.
