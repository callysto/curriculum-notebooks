    "However, in the real world there are **statistical fluctuations**, meaning that experimental data are not always equal to what you would expect. For example, if you were to flip a coin 100 times, you might observe 52 heads and 48 tails or even 45 heads and 55 tails. Of course the more times you flip a coin and record the outcome, the closer you are likely to get to a 50:50 ratio.\n",

    "In this notebook we covered the idea of statistical fluctuations and how we can use the random number generator to model those statistical fluctuations. In doing so, we created a simulation of coin tosses for both fair and biased coins and observed the difference in counting simulated experimental statistics between the two. This sort of model can be applied to nearly any statistical process, and can act as a primer for the idea of statistical simulations and [Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)."
