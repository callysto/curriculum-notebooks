    "# Data Analysis: Mean, Median, and Mode\n",

    "Mean, median, and mode are known as measures of central tendency because they tell us where data is centered or clustered together. We will also talk about range.\n",

    "## Definitions and Examples\n",

    "### 1. Range\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of values, the **range** is the difference between the highest value and the lowest value. This tells us if the values are spread apart or close together. \n",

    "##### Example\n",
