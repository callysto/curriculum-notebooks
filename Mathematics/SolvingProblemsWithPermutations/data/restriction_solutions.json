        "explaination" : "1. First we look at how many ways to rearrage APPLE. Since apple has 5 letters, we know it's 5!. However, there are two P's so we must divide by 2!. Now we subtract the number of ways we can arrange APPLE where two P's ARE togther. If we consider the P's as one letter we get 4! since there would 4 letters (A{PP}LE). Therefore we have:"

        "solution" : "$$2! = 2$$",
        "explaination" : "2. Since there are only two different makes of cars and they have to be together, we can group all the Aston Martins as one object and all the Porches as one object. Therefore we have 2 objects. How many different ways can we arrange 2 objects?: "

        "solution" : "$$9! - 7! = 357840$$",
        "explaination" : "3. First we start with the number of ways we can arrange the objects such that all the JK Rowling books are together and there are no restrictions on Tolkien books. If we consider the Rowling books as one object, we have 9 objects altogther. Therefore we have 9! number of ways to rearrange the objects with no restrictions on Tolkien books. Now we subtract the number of ways we can arrange the objects when the Tolkien books ARE beside each other. If we consider the Tolkien books as one object, then we have 7 objects or 7! ways to arrange the books. Therefore we have:"

How many different ways can the coach make the 4x100m teams when at least one of the teams has to be all girls?",

        "explaination" : "4. Let's start with the group of girls first. We have 7 girls and each group is a group of 4. Therefore, we have 7 choices and 4 slots to put them in for the group of all girls. Now we have the group of girls, we continue to the next group. We have 8 people remaining and 4 slots to put them in. For the final group we only have 4 people left, therefore we can rearrange them in exactly 4! ways. Using this knowledge we put together the solution: "
