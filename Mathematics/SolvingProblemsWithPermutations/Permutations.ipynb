    "# Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "*by Nathan Tipper*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, we will explore the concept of permutations, as they arise in certain types of counting problems. Questions that can be answered using permutations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"How many 6-letter words can I form using letters of the alphabet?\" (Regardless of whether or not it's a dictionary word)\n",
    "- \"How many different ways can we sit four people in four different chairs?\"\n",
    "- \"How many different ways can group a classroom of *x* students?\"\n",
    "- \"How many different ways can you arrange the books on your bookshelf?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore permutations through a series of interactive visualizations involving coloured circles, starting with the simple problem of counting rearrangements, and building up to more complicated examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a permutation?\n",
    "A permutation is the act of rearranging the elements of a set in another order or sequence. A permutation can also refer to the act of choosing some number of elements from a larger set (i.e. a subset) and placing them in order. The most important feature of a permutation is that the order matters (as opposed to a combination, where we choose a subset from a larger set, but the order does not matter). Take the example below. We have a set in which there are 5 different circles, distinguished by their colour. We can consider this a set of circles. If we change the order of the circles in this set (or even if we do nothing at all!), then we have defined a permutation of the set."

(In fact, there's a good chance that even if you major in mathematics in university, you won't see a precise definition!) But there are two commonly understood features of sets that do not correspond to what we're doing. First, the order of elements in a set doesn't matter. Second, repeating an element of a set does not change the set. (For example, the set $\\{1,2,3,3\\}$ would not be any different than the set $\\{1,2,3\\}$.)\n",
    "\n",
    " In the context of permutations, order matters, and we will sometimes want to allow repetitions. One could argue that what we call \"sets\" in this notebook should really be referred to as \"ordered lists\". But let's decide not to quibble.\n",

    "- Permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    " We should also warn you that to a mathematician, the word \"permutation\" refers to something much more restrictive than what we are considering. In university-level mathematics, only rearrangements where every element of a set is used, and used only once, are considered permutations. This type of permutation turns out to be very useful in higher mathematics, but it won't be enough for some of the counting problems we want to consider."

Now, if we take all the items out and rearrage them, there are several possibilities, including { Green, Red, Blue}.\n",

How many different options do we have for what we place in the first blank circle? We still have all the circles in our original set, and we can put any of the circles in the first spot, so we have three choices. Let's say we choose Green. Now, how many options do we have for the second circle? We already put Green in the first spot, so now there are only two options left: red or blue. We started with three, now two. If we go one step further, we only have once choice left. Overall, we made $3\\times 2\\times 1 = 6$ choices.\n",

    "\n",
    "Problem: Rearrange the letters in BANANA such that no N's are adjacent. In how many ways can this be done?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at this problem, we need to look at how many ways we can arrange the word BANANA. We have six letters in the word and six slots to put them in, so therefore it would appear that we have $6!$ possiblities in total. However, we have 2 letters that have repetition: N is repeated twice, and A is repeated three times. So we have to consider that three A's when rearranged in different ways spell out the exact same word while also considering the two N's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have three A's and two N's, we must divide by the number of ways these letters could be rearranged without changing the word. There are $3!$ ways to rearrange the A's, and $2!$ ways to rearrange the $N's$, so we're down to $\\frac{6!}{3!2!} = 60$ possibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have to think about the number of ways that we can arrange the word BANANA such that two N's are adjacent. We can see that if we take out the N's in BANANA we are left with BAAA, which can be arranged in 4 different ways: since we have 4 letters with 3 repetitions, we have $\\frac{4!}{3!}=4$ possibilities. Now, if we consider all options where the N's are together then we can consider the two N's as a single letter. There are 5 places where we could place NN in a four letter word: in front, after the first letter, after the second, after the third, or at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the number of ways we can rearrange BANANA with repetitions of N is $5\\times 4 = 20$, since we can consider the N's as the same letter we have $\\frac{5!}{3!} where the denominator comes from the three A's we have. Putting it together, we have the number of words we can make total with the 6 letters (60) minus the number of words we can make with N being adjacent to each other (20) then we get $60 - 20 = 40$ different ways we can rearrange BANANA such that no N's are adjacent.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The term 'permutations' is used whenever we're dealing with counting problems where the order in which we arrange our items matters. The simplest type of permutation (which is what mathematicians think of when they hear the word 'permutation') is the action of taking some number of items and placing them in an order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we have $n$ *distinct* items, then there are $n!$ different orders in which we can place them.\n",
    "- If some of those items are identical, then we need to account for rearrangements that exchange identical items (producing indistinguishable results). If there are $k$ identical items in a set of $n$ items, then the number of distinguishable permutations is $\\dfrac{n!}{k!}$.\n",
    "- If more than one type of item is repeated, we divide as above for each such type.\n",
    "- If we are choosing a *subset* of size $r$ from a set of $n$ distinct items and placing them in an order, then the number of possibilities is $_nP_r = \\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different counting problems can be solved using permutations and the above considerations. The study of permutations (and their cousin, *combinations*, which we'll discuss in another notebook) form the beginnings of an area of mathematics known as *combinatorics* -- the theory of counting."
