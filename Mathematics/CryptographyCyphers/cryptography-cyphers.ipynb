    "### What Is Cryptography?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is the application and study of methods for secure communications in the presence of third parties (called adversaries). That is, how can we communicate messages in a confidential manner in such a way that only our intended readers can view the message?\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of converting an ordinary message (called the _plain text_) into one that cannot be read (called the _cipher text_) is **encryption**. The reverse process of figuring out the plaintext message in a cipher text is called **decryption**. An important note to make here is that the process of encryption should not only assemble the plain text into a cipher text, but also handle the reverse. If this was not so, then such a method of encryption would not be of much use as our intended reader would not be able to read the message! \n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography concerns itself with a process by which an encrypted message is made non-readable, but is readable for the intended reader who decrypts it. But in the real world, there are always adversaries trying to decrypt messages not intended for them. This drives the progress in both the improvement of encryption and decryption techniques, as those willing to secure their messages find methods of better encryption and at the same time find methods of decryption to seek the weaknesses of current encryption methods today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, cryptography was based on this concept of message confidentiality. Encryption attempted to secure the secrecy of communications for spies, military leaders, and diplomats. But its modern usage has grown to encompass more than just the encryption of simple messages. We now use it for identity authentication, digital signatures, secure computation, banking, and the processing of online payment transactions.\n",

    "### What Is Modular Arithmetic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers. The main idea is that numbers \"wrap around\" once a certain value, called the **modulus** is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some familiar use of modular arithmetic is the 12-hour clock. Usual addition suggests that if it is 10:00 now, then 5 hours later it would be 15:00, since $10 + 5 = 15$. But this is not the case, since in a 12-hour clock, the time \"wraps around\" every 12 hours. So the time is 3:00. In a 12-hour clock, the arithmetic used is **modulo 12**. Another familiar use of modular arithmetic is the modern calendar system (the Gregorian calendar), the arithmetic used is modulo 365 (or 366 during leap years).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic can be demonstrated visually. Consider the following clockface below. In this clockface, we can work out $6+3$ modulo $7$ by starting at $6$ then moving $3$ spaces clockwise, which bring us to $2$.\n",

    "### Mathematics of Modular Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, we are familiar with the **equality relation** on the integers. The equality relation tells us that two integers are the same. For example, $5=5$. The equality relation even tells us when two statements are the same, for example, $3+7+1 = 9+2$. Some other relations that we may be familiar with are **inequality relations** such as: $<,\\leq,>$, and $\\geq$, for example $3<5, 3\\leq 5, 11 >3$, and $11 \\geq 11$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With modular arithmetic, a different type of relation on the integers is used, called a **congruence relation**, denoted by $\\equiv$ (like the equals symbol, but with an extra horizontal bar). With the congruence relation, we can use operations such as addition and subtraction (there are other operations that are valid too, but we will be looking at modular arithmetic with the addition and subtraction operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "We now introduce the formal definition as to when two integers $a$ and $b$ are **congruent modulo $n$**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** For a positive integer $n$, two numbers $a$ and $b$ are congruent modulo $n$ if their difference $a-b$ is a multiple of $n$ (meaning, there is an integer $k$ such that $a-b =kn$). We denote this congruence relation by:\n",
    "$$a \\equiv b \\pmod{n}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not worry if you are struggling to understand the definition. Proceed on reading the examples below, as these examples should help in demystifying what the definition says.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in our 12-hour clock example, 15:00 is the same as 3:00. This we would write mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{12}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we say that $15$ and $3$ are congruent modulo $12$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks:** The choice of modulo is essential! Here our choice is $12$ as we are dealing with the 12-hour clock, but a different choice of modulo would require us to make some changes. We also remark that we are not multiplying $3$ with $(\\text{mod }{12})$. The modulo inside the parentheses is simply for bookkeeping purposes!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we wrote $15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{12}$ to say that \"$15$ and $3$ are congruent modulo $12$\". Using the definition, we see that this is so, since \n",
    "\n",
    "$$15-3 = 1 \\cdot 12$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where we have used $a=15,b=3,k=1$, and $n=12$ in the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$15 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the definition, we again see that this is so since $15-5=10=2\\cdot 5$, so we used that $a=15,b=5,k=2,n=5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$35 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simply write the statement above as $35\\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}$, using $a=35,b=5,k=7,n=5$ in the definition. Typically, in writing congruence relations between two integers, we want to reduce $b$ to the smallest positive integer for which the congruence relation holds true."

Until the advent of mechanization, secret messages would have to be encoded (and decoded) by hand, so techniques were relatively simple to implement, usually just variations of the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher and its successors are collectively referred to as **substitution ciphers**.\n",

    "One popular implementation was the [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher), which is effectively a Caesar cipher that employs a new shift with each successive letter. A codeword would be used to determine how much to shift each letter by, which required a Vigenère square (*tabula recta* in Latin) and the codeword to be known in advance by the sender and the receiver:\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if the codeword is **TABLE**, and the first word of the plaintext message is **IMPORTANT**, you would look for the row in the table for **T**, and across the top row for the column labelled **I**. The first letter of the cipher text would then be **B**. The rest of the letters would follow (looping back to the front of the codeword) as such:\n",

    "The weakness of the Vigenère cipher is that the codeword has to be repeated throughout, as it's usually much shorter than the length of the message it's encoding. [One-time pads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) get around this weakness by using a codeword that is both extremely long (longer than any message it would encode), and contains a string of letters that are truly random. Used properly, a one-time pad cipher is impossible to crack, but it requires both the sender and the receiver to have an agreed-upon codeword that likely would need to be recorded somewhere, instead of a simple codeword that could be easily remembered."

After World War I, codebreakers maintained the upper hand over the code makers, so following the war there was an effort to find better encryption systems. Cryptographers looked at incorporating technology in order to mechanize secrecy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invented in the 15th century by Italian architect Leon Alberti, was the earliest cryptographic machine, called the cipher disk. It can encrypt a message with a simple Caesar shift, or in a more complicated way using a keyword, but as we previously explored, these methods of encryption have serious weaknesses. They could be decrypted by brute force (that is, by trying all 26 of the possible shifts) or by frequency analysis.\n",

One of their pet projects was to replace inadequate systems of cryptography used in World War I. Their resulting solution would be called Enigma (pictured below). This cipher machine would become the most feared system of encryption in history, and was instrumental in Germany's military success for most of World War II\n",

    "<center><img src=\"./images/enigma.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"height: 400px\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Enigma Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Scherbius' Enigma machine was made of several ingenious components. These components form an intricate cipher machine. We will look at a simplified and basic version of Scherbius' machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic form consists of three elements, each connected by wires:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Keyboard:** which receives plain text inputs\n",
    "* **Scrambling unit:** encrypts each plain text letter into a cipher text letter\n",
    "* **Display board:** consists of various lamps that indicates the cipher text letter\n",
    "\n",
    "The scrambler is the most important part of the Enigma. The internal wirings of the scrambler determines the encryption. A plain text letter is entered on the keyboard, then the scrambler makes a series of twists and turns to yield the cipher text letter. The diagram below shows a simplified version of how the Enigma works for a keyboard with six letters. (Keep in mind that the original Enigma had 26 letters.) Everytime a letter input is received, the scrambler rotates by one place, which changes how each letter is encrypted, so the encryption for typing in the same letter six times in a row is constantly changing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrasting the Enigma machine with a substitution cypher, in typing \"AAAAAA\" in the Enigma machine, we might get something like \"KPXVTR\" and if we were to type \"AAAAAA\" again, we will get something like \"VRTSOP\", where as using a substitution cypher, we simply get something like \"RRRRRR\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./images/scramblers.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scramblers & Reflector\n",
    "\n",
    "With the scrambler, typing the same letter enough times will repeat the pattern of the encryption. In general, cryptographers want to avoid repetition because it leads to any identifiable pattern of a cipher text. With the Enigma machine, there would be three scramblers, and the advantage of adding additional scramblers is that the pattern of encryption is not repeated until all the scramblers are back to their original position. For instance, the advantage of adding the second scrambler is that the first scrambler first needs to do twenty-six complete revolutions until returning to its original position. With three scramblers, each of which set in one of 26 orientations, we already have $26\\times 26 \\times 26 = 17,576$ settings!\n",
    "\n",
    "Scherbius increased security by allowing the scramblers to be removable and interchangeable, and the arrangement of scramblers affects the encryption. With three scramblers, there are six different ways to arrange them, and this increased the possible initial settings by a factor of six.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature is the reflector, which receives the incoming signal and sends it back to the three scramblers in a different route. Its static nature does not add to the number of cipher alphabets, however, its usage would be visible when it comes to encrypting and decrypting messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./images/scramblersreflectors.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Plugboards\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature of the Enigma machine is the plugboard between the keyboard and the scramblers. The plugboard allows for the sender to insert cables, which swaps the letters before they enter the scrambler. The Enigma operator would have six cables, which means that six pairs of letters can be swapped, leaving fourteen that are unplugged and unswapped. The number of ways of connecting six pairs of letters out of 26 is 100,391,791,500:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Enigma-plugboard.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of configurations is the product of the three numbers determined by the scrambler orientations, scrambler arrangements, and the plugboard connections. In total, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$17,576 \\times  6 \\times 100,391,791,500 \\approx 10,000,000,000,000,000$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, there are about 10 quadrillion possible ways to set up the Enigma, and an interceptor would have to check every single one of them in order to crack the cipher text. To put this into perspective, a group of cryptanalysts capable of checking one setting every minute would take longer than the age of the universe to check every setting!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cracking the Enigma\n",
    "\n",
    "During World War II, the Germans made improvements to the Enigma machine by increasing the number of plugboards to ten, increasing the number of possible configurations to $159,000,000,000,000,000,000$ ($159$ sextillion).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1926, British cryptanalysts continued monitoring German communications, and their ability to gather intelligence diminished quickly. Even with the help of Americans and the French, the Enigma cipher was beyond their decrypting abilities. During this time, Germany had the most secure communication the world had ever seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the British could decrypt the Germans' messages, then they would be able to pick up news of imminent attacks and send reinforcements or take evasive actions. For thirteen years, the Americans, the British, and the French assumed that the Enigma was unbreakable, and it was only after this much time that they found hope. With the help of the knowledge of Polish cryptanalysts attempting to break the Enigma, the Code and Cypher School was started in Bletchley Park. This codebreaking organization would eventually be joined by Alan Turing (pictured below) who would eventually pave the way for breaking the Enigma machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was with Turing's observations with the accumulation of Bletchley Park's library of decrypted messages from the Enigma machine that he noticed a rigid structure. For instance, his experience revealed that at certain times of the day, the Germans sent weather reports, and would almost certainly contain the word WETTER, the German word for weather. In cryptanalysis this is what's known as a *crib*, an often repeated or well-known pattern that can be used as a clue to crack a code. Turing used this knowledge to reduce the problem of finding scrambler settings to that of finding the plugboard settings. If he could find something in the crib, then he could reduce the number of scrambler combinations that needs to be checked, and eventually deduce the plugboard cabling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Turing's strategy, along with the help of other cryptanalysts and prototype computers (such as the Bombe) would be the vital breakthrough in breaking the Enigma. The Enigma's configurations were changed everyday, but once the plugboard cabling and scrambler settings had been established for a particular message, the Enigma's configuration for that particular day was deduced, and all the other messages from the same day would be deciphered. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been estimated that this work at Bletchley shortened the war by more than two years and prevented the death of fourteen million lives. Beyond the wartime applications, the electromechanical innovation that came out of codebreaking paved the way for the modern computer.\n",

    "The security of the RSA is based on two mathematical problems: [Factoring Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization) and the [RSA Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_problem). \n",
    "\n",
    "We look at one particular aspect of the RSA, and this aspect is the number $N$, which allows is used in the construction of a one-way function reversible only if the decoder has the public key. In the following discussion below, we have simplified the nuances involved in the actual mathematics and implementation used in the RSA, we are looking at $N$ and how it relates to the factoring problem, whereas in the RSA, the actual public key, private key, and the one-way function are more sophisticated - it is beyond the extent of this notebook to discuss how these are defined mathematically. \n",

    "## Public-key Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "The asymmetry begins with Alice choosing $N$, a personalized one-way function, this she does by choosing two prime numbers $p$ and $q$, and multiplies them together. So \n",
    "\n",
    "$$N=p \\times q.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a **prime number** is a number with no positive divisors other than itself and $1$ (for example, $13$ is prime, since no integer other than $1$ and $13$ can divide $13$, however, $12$ is not prime, since it is divisible by numbers like $2$, $3$, $4$, or $6$).\n",
    "\n",
    "If Alice chooses $p=17,159$ and $q=10,247$, then she gets:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N=p \\times q = 17,159 \\times 10,247 = 175,828,273.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This $N$ value become Alice's public encryption key. It does not matter if this is visible to others. We can think of $N$ as the public key, where as the values $p$ and $q$ are the private keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think that just because everybody knows $N$, it would be easy to find $p$ and $q$ to read Alice's messages. But this is not the case when $N$ is really large. The fundamental aspect of the RSA cipher is that it is easy to make $N$, but very hard to find $p$ and $q$ from $N$, this is what makes it a one-way function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we were given $p=17,159$ and $q=10,247$ as before, it does not take a lot of effort for a calculator to calculate $N=175,828,273$. But now, think about it in reverse, suppose you were given $N=175,828,273$ without the knowledge of what $p$ and $q$ is. How can you determine $p$ and $q$ from $N$? \n",
    "\n",
    "What we have demonstrated here is that even if you could find $p$ and $q$, what is demonstrated here is that the computation of $N$ was easier than being given $N$ without knowledge of what $p$ and $q$ values were used, then finding $p$ and $q$ from $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system of asymmetry in cryptography is a form of **public-key cryptography**. For really secured messages, one would choose really large values for $p$ and $q$, for instance, a value larger than $10^{65}$, which would result in an $N$ value that is as large as $10^{130}$. A computer would calculate $N$ quickly, but if Eve wanted to get $p$ and $q$, it would take her way longer. For instance, banking transactions today use $N$ values with key sizes as large as $2^{4096}\\approx 10^{1477}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is now routine to encrypt a message with $N$ values so large, that even with all the computers on the planet working to decrypt the message, it would still take longer than the age of the universe to break the cipher!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It is conjectural whether the strength of the RSA will remain in the future. The strength of the RSA is tied to a fundamentally difficult mathematical problem, that of factoring. For over two thousand years, mathematicians have failed to find a shortcut of finding the prime factors of large composite numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most mathematicians, factoring is an inherently difficult problem that will remain to be unsolved for decades to come. If this assumption is true, then RSA remains to be one of the most secure ways in transmitting messages; however, if a technique is found for factoring large numbers quickly, (such as [fast factoring algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) designed for [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing)) then the RSA will no longer be secure. This is a popular topic right now in mathematics and computer science, referred to as the [P vs NP problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a post quantum computing world, we would need to consider [cryptographic procedures that are secure against an attack by a quantum computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography).  \n",
