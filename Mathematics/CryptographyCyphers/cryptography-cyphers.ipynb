It can encrypt a message with a simple Caesar shift, or in a more complicated way using a keyword, but as we previously explored, these methods of encryption have serious weaknesses. They could be decrypted by brute force (that is, by trying all 26 of the possible shifts) or by frequency analysis.\n", "\n", "<img src=\"./images/cipherdisk.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n", "\n", "In 1918, German inventors Arthur Scherbius and Richard Ritter founded the company Scherbius & Ritter, an engineering firm that worked with many mechanical objects from turbines to heated pillows. One of their pet projects was to replace inadequate systems of cryptography used in World War I. Their resulting solution would be called Enigma (pictured below).

The internal wirings of the scrambler determines the encryption. A plain text letter is entered on the keyboard, then the scrambler makes a series of twists and turns to yield the cipher text letter. The diagram below shows a simplified version of how the Enigma works for a keyboard with six letters. (Keep in mind that the original Enigma had 26 letters.) Everytime a letter input is received, the scrambler rotates by one place, which changes how each letter is encrypted, so the encryption for typing in the same letter six times in a row is constantly changing!\n", "\n", "Contrasting the Enigma machine with a substitution cypher, in typing \"AAAAAA\" in the Enigma machine, we might get something like \"KPXVTR\" and if we were to type \"AAAAAA\" again, we will get something like \"VRTSOP\", where as using a substitution cypher, we simply get something like \"RRRRRR\".\n", "\n", "<img src=\"./images/scramblers.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n", "\n", "### The Scramblers & Reflector\n", "\n", "With the scrambler, typing the same letter enough times will repeat the pattern of the encryption. In general, cryptographers want to avoid repetition because it leads to any identifiable pattern of a cipher text. With the Enigma machine, there would be three scramblers, and the advantage of adding additional scramblers is that the pattern of encryption is not repeated until all the scramblers are back to their original position. For instance, the advantage of adding the second scrambler is that the first scrambler first needs to do twenty-six complete revolutions until returning to its original position. With three scramblers, each of which set in one of 26 orientations, we already have $26\\times 26 \\times 26 = 17,576$ settings!\n", "\n", "Scherbius increased security by allowing the scramblers to be removable and interchangeable, and the arrangement of scramblers affects the encryption. With three scramblers, there are six different ways to arrange them, and this increased the possible initial settings by a factor of six.\n", "\n", "Another feature is the reflector, which receives the incoming signal and sends it back to the three scramblers in a different route.

For thirteen years, the Americans, the British, and the French assumed that the Enigma was unbreakable, and it was only after this much time that they found hope. With the help of the knowledge of Polish cryptanalysts attempting to break the Enigma, the Code and Cypher School was started in Bletchley Park. This codebreaking organization would eventually be joined by Alan Turing (pictured below) who would eventually pave the way for breaking the Enigma machine.\n", "\n", "It was with Turing's observations with the accumulation of Bletchley Park's library of decrypted messages from the Enigma machine that he noticed a rigid structure. For instance, his experience revealed that at certain times of the day, the Germans sent weather reports, and would almost certainly contain the word WETTER, the German word for weather. This would be known as a crib. Turing used this knowledge to reduce the problem of finding scrambler settings to that of finding the plugboard settings. If he could find something in the crib, then he could reduce the number of scrambler combinations that needs to be checked, and eventually deduce the plugboard cabling. \n", "\n", "Turing's strategy, along with the help of other cryptanalysts and prototype computers (such as the Bombe) would be the vital breakthrough in breaking the Enigma. The Enigma's configurations were changed everyday, but once the plugboard cabling and scrambler settings had been established for a particular message, the Enigma's configuration for that particular day was deduced, and all the other messages from the same day would be deciphered. \n", "\n", "It has been estimated that this work at Bletchley shortened the war by more than two years and prevented the death of fourteen million lives.\n", "\n", "<img src=\"./images/alanturing.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["---\n", "<h1 align='center'>Applications of Cryptography: Modern</h1>\n", "\n", "## RSA\n", "\n", "In our discussion of cyphers, we have implicitly been talking about a **key**, which is a piece of information that determines the output of a cryptographic procedure. \n", "\n", "With all the previous cyphers (Caesar, Substitution, and Enigma) we have been discussing, one feature has been prevalent: encrypters and decrypters needs to use the same key - these type of cyphers are known to be **symmetric cyphers**.\n", "\n", "It was in 1977 that a group of mathematicians and computer scientists named Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (in the picture below) mulled over a question that was troubling cryptanalysts: is it possible to build an **asymmetric cipher**?

But this is not the case when $N$ is really large. The fundamental aspect of the RSA cipher is that it is easy to make $N$, but very hard to find $p$ and $q$ from $N$, this is what makes it a one-way function.\n", "\n", "For instance, if we were given $p=17,159$ and $q=10,247$ as before, it does not take a lot of effort for a calculator to calculate $N=175,828,273$. But now, think about it in reverse, suppose you were given $N=175,828,273$ without the knowledge of what $p$ and $q$ is. How can you determine $p$ and $q$ from $N$? \n", "\n", "What we have demonstrated here is that even if you could find $p$ and $q$, what is demonstrated here is that the computation of $N$ was easier than being given $N$ without knowledge of what $p$ and $q$ values were used, then finding $p$ and $q$ from $N$.\n", "\n", "This system of asymmetry in cryptography is a form of **public-key cryptography**. For really secured messages, one would choose really large values for $p$ and $q$, for instance, a value larger than $10^{65}$, which would result in an $N$ value that is as large as $10^{130}$. A computer would calculate $N$ quickly, but if Eve wanted to get $p$ and $q$, it would take her way longer.
