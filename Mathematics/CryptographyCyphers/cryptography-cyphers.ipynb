    "### What Is Cryptography?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is about how to communicate so that only our intended readers can get the information. It is the application and study of methods for secure communications in the presence of third parties (called adversaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of converting an ordinary message (called the _plain text_) into one that cannot be read (called the _cipher text_) is **encryption**. The reverse process of figuring out the plaintext message in a cipher text is called **decryption**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography concerns itself with a process by which an encrypted message is made non-readable, but can be made readable by decryption. In the real world there are always adversaries trying to decrypt messages not intended for them, which drives the improvement of both encryption and decryption techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is also now used for identity authentication, digital signatures, secure computation, banking, and the processing of online payment transactions."

    "### What Is Modular Arithmetic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers. The main idea is that numbers \"wrap around\" once a certain value, called the **modulus** is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example of modular arithmetic is the 12-hour clock. Usual addition suggests that if it is 10:00 now, then 5 hours later it would be 15:00, since $10 + 5 = 15$. But this is not the case, since in a 12-hour clock, the time \"wraps around\" every 12 hours. So the time is 3:00. In a 12-hour clock, the arithmetic used is **modulo 12**. Another familiar use of modular arithmetic is the modern (Gregorian) calendar system, the arithmetic used is modulo 365 (or 366 during leap years).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic can be demonstrated visually. Consider the following clockface below. In this clockface, we can work out $6+3$ modulo $7$ by starting at $6$ then moving $3$ spaces clockwise, which bring us to $2$.\n",

    "### Mathematics of Modular Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, we are familiar with the **equality relation** on the integers. The equality relation tells us that two integers are the same. For example, $5=5$. The equality relation even tells us when two statements are the same, for example, $3+7+1 = 9+2$. Some other relations that we may be familiar with are **inequality relations** such as: $<,\\leq,>$, and $\\geq$, for example $3 < 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With modular arithmetic, a different type of relation on the integers is used, called a **congruence relation**, denoted by $\\equiv$ (like the equals symbol, but with an extra horizontal bar). We will be looking at modular arithmetic with addition and subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in our 12-hour clock example, 15:00 is the same as 3:00. This we would write mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{12}.$$\n",

    "### A Brief History & Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who, according to Suetonius, used it to protect messages of military significance. It is not known as to how effective the Caesar cipher was during its time, but it was likely reasonably secure since most of Caesar's enemies were illiterate and would assume that encrypted letters were written in a foreign language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cryptography, the **Caesar Cipher** is also known as the **Shift Cipher**, which is one of the simplest encryption techniques. It is a type of **Substitution Cipher** in which each letter is replaced by some fixed number of positions down in the alphabet. In more generality, a Substitution Cipher is any method of encryption by which plain text characters are replaced with cipher text according to some fixed system: either to single letters, pairs of letters, triplets, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Is Modular Arithmetic Used in the Caesar Cipher?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Caesar cipher, modular arithmetic can be used by first transforming the letters into numbers."

For instance, with a shift of three, `a` becomes `d`, `b` becomes `e`, `c` becomes `f`, and so on. If we were to encode the word `CAESAR` with the Caesar cipher with a shift of three, then `CAESAR` is encoded as `FDHVDU`."
