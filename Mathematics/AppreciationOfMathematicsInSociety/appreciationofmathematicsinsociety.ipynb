    "Work on creating the metric system of measurement was started during the French Revolution. In Canada, we use the metric system for measuring length, mass, area, and volume. However, this was not always true. Before using the metric system, Canada used the British Imperial system of measurement. Canada's change over to the metric system during the 1970s led to lots of problems. One of these problems was the fuel conversion mistake that led to Air Canada Flight 143 almost crashing in 1983."

Great thinkers of the time began basing their ideas on rationalism and the observable natural world instead of the mystical sources of the past. The committee on weights and measures decided that the metre should be based on a naturally observed distance. The length of the metre would be one ten millionth of the length of a quarter of the earth's circumference. In mathematical terms, this meant that if the circumference of the earth was $C$ and the length of a metre was $x$, the length of the metre would be given by\n",

With malfunctioning fuel gauges and a huge imperial-to-metric conversion mistake, what should have been a routine trip turned into a terrifying crisis. It was only due to the expert gliding of Captain Robert Pearson and the geographical knowledge of First Officer Maurice Quintal that the aircraft was crash landed safely and 69 people avoided tragedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flight 143 was scheduled to travel from Montreal to Edmonton, with a stopover in Ottawa. The flight crew knew that the fuel gauges weren't working properly. So, during the stopover in Ottawa, Captain Pearson made sure that the fuel levels were checked manually. The ground crew said that the flight had 11,430 liters of fuel in the tanks. Using this number, the flight crew calculated that they had 20,400 kilograms of fuel. This was more than enough to make it to Edmonton. Captain Pearson and First Officer Quintal checked the calculations three times. However, each time they calculated, they used the *wrong unit conversion*!\n",
    "\n",
    "The flight crew wanted to know how many kilograms of fuel they had on board. However, they hadn't been properly trained in the new metric way of measuring. They knew roughly how many liters of fuel were on the plane, so they used the following calculation to derive the mass of fuel:\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> mass = $\\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{volume}}\\times$ volume. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they used the conversion factor of 1.77 pounds/liter. Therefore, their calculation led to this incorrect number:\n",

    "\n",
    "Maybe you can see the problem with their calculation. They found out how many **pounds** of fuel they had on board, not how many **kilograms** they had. However, they read this as 20,231.1 **kilograms** of fuel! Since they hadn't been trained on the new system, they didn't know that they should have used the conversion factor of 0.8 kilograms/liter. Therefore, they should have calculated that they had\n",

    "The crew actually only had half as much fuel as they thought they did. When fuel was critical at 12,500 metres up, near the Ontario/Manitoba border, the crew went into emergency mode and requested clearance to land at Winnipeg. However, fuel ran out completely on the way to Winnipeg. Luckily, Co-pilot Quintal knew about an out-of-use military base at Gimli, Manitoba. With this knowledge and Captain Pearson's years of flying gliders, the crew made for Gimli. It was a quiet glide until the plane broke through the cloud cover and the flight crew saw that over 100 people had gathered on the runways for \"Family Day\" of the Winnipeg Sport Car Club.\n",
    "\n",
    "The people attending the drag races scattered as the airplane got closer and closer to the runway. A guard rail had been installed on the runway to create two drag lanes for racing. It was lucky that the guard rail was there, because the plane's front landing gear failed, and the crew had to land the nose of the plane on the guard rail to keep it from smashing into the ground. After skidding down the runway, the plane finally stopped about 100 metres from the crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the 69 people on board Flight 143 survived the crash landing. There were only 10 minor injuries, all of which happened when the passengers were using the escape slides. These slides were almost straight up and down since the front landing gear had failed. \n",

    "The introduction of the Metric System of Measurement gave an easy alternative to the confusing Imperial System. Not only were unit conversions easy, but the units for length, area, volume, and mass were finally related to each other in a straightforward way. Although most countries adopted the Metric System, the transition was not always smooth. It is always critical that, for any calculations involving units of measurement, you keep track of the units and convert them properly!\n",

    "    <li> Look at the calculation for how many pounds of fuel Flight 143 had on board (20,231.1 pounds). Now look at the correct calculation of 9144 kilograms. Using the conversion factor from FRENCH REVOLUTION, convert 20,231.1 pounds into kilograms. Did you get 9144 kilograms? Why might your number be different from 9144 kilograms? (**Hint:** think of the conversion factor 0.8 kg/L. Given that this is a real calculation, how many decimal places would be reasonable to expect?) </li>\n",
