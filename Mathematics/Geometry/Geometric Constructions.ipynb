    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A long time ago, there lived the ancient Greek mathematician, Euclid.\n",
    "The dates of his birth and death are not exactly known, but it is believed he lived between the years 325 - 270 BC.\n",
    "He lived in Alexandria, Egypt, at a time when Egypt was ruled by the Greeks, after Egypt was conquered by Alexander the Great.\n",
    "Euclid wrote the most successful math textbook of all time, the *Elements*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Elements* usn't just one book. It's actually a series of 13 books about geometry.\n",
    "Some of the books are about numbers, but the Greeks thought about numbers geometrically.\n",
    "For example, whereas we would say 2 \"divides\" 6, Euclid would say 2 \"measures\" 6.\n",
    "We say a prime number is a positive number divisble only by itself and 1.\n",
    "Euclid says a prime number is a number only \"measured\" by 1.\n",
    "When two numbers are multiplied together, Euclid calls this a \"plane\" number.\n",
    "Three numbers make a \"solid\" number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclid did something  monumental in the *Elements*.\n",
    "He assumed ten very basic facts (called \"postulates\" and \"common notions\"),\n",
    "and used these facts to prove hundreds more facts about geometry.\n",
    "For example, three of the things he assumed were\n",
    "\n",
    " * It is possible to draw a straight line between any two points (using a straightedge).\n",
    " * It is possible to draw a perfect circle with any center and radius (using a compass).\n",
    " * If two things are equal to a third thing, then those two things are equal to one another (If A = C and B = C, then A = B).\n",
    "\n",
    "He used these ten facts to prove an eleventh fact.\n",
    "Then he used these eleven to prove a twelfth.\n",
    "Then a thirteenth, a fourteenth, and so on.\n",
    "From ten facts, he proved more and more complex facts.\n",
    "In total, he proved more than 400 more facts (or \"propositions\") about geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Elements* was so successful that it was used as a mathematics textbook for more than 2000 years, until the 1900's.\n",
    "Today, different textbooks are used in schools, but many of the lessons are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to learn how to perform many different geometric constructions\n",
    "using only a straightedge and compass.\n",
    "The goal is to learn how to draw\n",
    "\n",
    " * an equilateral triangle;\n",
    " * a perpendicular bisector;\n",
    " * a perpendicular line through a point;\n",
    " * a parallel line through a point;\n",
    " * an angle bisector.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the first topics covered in Euclid's *Elements*.\n",
    "The *Elements* also teaches why these techniques work.\n",
    "This notebook will also show why some of these constructions work.\n",
    "However, since schools teach things in different orders,\n",
    "showing why might rely on a few facts you have not learned yet.\n",
    "The next section goes over these facts."

    "The word *congruent* means \"in agreement with\".\n",
    "In mathematics, we sometimes use the word congruent when things are very similar.\n",
    "Two triangles are **congruent** if you can get one triangle by sliding, rotating, or flipping the other triangle.\n",
    "It means that one triangle can be placed on top of the other triangle to make a perfect fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When two triangles are congruent, then they have the same side lengths and the same angles.\n",

    "## How to Draw an Equilateral Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "An **equilateral triangle** is a triangle whose sides are all the same length.\n",
    "In an equilateral triangle, all of the angles are the same, 60 degrees.\n",
    "To draw an equilateral triangle, you would likely draw its three sides one by one.\n",
    "Without a protractor, how can you be sure you are drawing your lines at the correct angles?\n",
    "Without a ruler, how can you be sure your lines are all of the correct length?\n",
    "The very first \"Proposition\" in Euclid's *Elements* shows how to draw a perfect equilateral triangle using a straightedge and compass.\n",
    "A straightedge lets you draw a perfectly straight line.\n",
    "A compass lets you draw a perfect circle.\n",
    "If you can draw a perfect line and a perfect circle, then you can draw a perfect equilateral triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process starts by assuming the first side of the triangle has already been drawn.\n",
    "So we start with a line segment $AB$.\n",
    "Our goal is to draw an equilateral triangle whose base is $AB$.\n",
    "In the applet below, the left side shows what we start with.\n",
    "The right side shows what we want to make.\n",
    "You can move the starting points around and see how the shape on the right changes."

    "There are some things that Euclid and the ancient Greeks could not do.\n",
    "They were able to bisect an angle, just like we did.\n",
    "However, using only a striaghtedge and compass, they were not able to cut any random angle into *three* equal pieces.\n",
    "(This is called \"trisecting\" an angle.)\n",
