    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A long time ago, there lived the ancient Greek mathematician, Euclid.\n",
    "The dates of his birth and death are not exactly known, but it is believed he lived between the years 325 - 270 BC.\n",
    "He lived in Alexandria, Egypt, at a time when Egypt was ruled by the Greeks, after Egypt was conquered by Alexander the Great.\n",
    "Euclid wrote the most successful math textbook of all time, the *Elements*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Elements* usn't just one book. It's actually a series of 13 books about geometry.\n",
    "Some of the books are about numbers, but the Greeks thought about numbers geometrically.\n",
    "For example, whereas we would say 2 \"divides\" 6, Euclid would say 2 \"measures\" 6.\n",
    "We say a prime number is a positive number divisble only by itself and 1.\n",
    "Euclid says a prime number is a number only \"measured\" by 1.\n",
    "When two numbers are multiplied together, Euclid calls this a \"plane\" number.\n",
    "Three numbers make a \"solid\" number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclid did something  monumental in the *Elements*.\n",
    "He assumed ten very basic facts (called \"postulates\" and \"common notions\"),\n",
    "and used these facts to prove hundreds more facts about geometry.\n",
    "For example, three of the things he assumed were\n",
    "\n",
    " * It is possible to draw a straight line between any two points (using a straightedge).\n",
    " * It is possible to draw a perfect circle with any center and radius (using a compass).\n",
    " * If two things are equal to a third thing, then those two things are equal to one another (If A = C and B = C, then A = B).\n",
    "\n",
    "He used these ten facts to prove an eleventh fact.\n",
    "Then he used these eleven to prove a twelfth.\n",
    "Then a thirteenth, a fourteenth, and so on.\n",
    "From ten facts, he proved more and more complex facts.\n",
    "In total, he proved more than 400 more facts (or \"propositions\") about geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/elements.jpg\" title=\"Source: Folger Shakespeare Library\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Elements* was so successful that it was used as a mathematics textbook for more than 2000 years, until the 1900's.\n",
    "Today, different textbooks are used in schools, but many of the lessons are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to learn how to perform many different geometric constructions\n",
    "using only a straightedge and compass.\n",
    "The goal is to learn how to draw\n",
    "\n",
    " * an equilateral triangle;\n",
    " * a perpendicular bisector;\n",
    " * a perpendicular line through a point;\n",
    " * a parallel line through a point;\n",
    " * an angle bisector.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the first topics covered in Euclid's *Elements*.\n",
    "The *Elements* also teaches why these techniques work.\n",
    "This notebook will also show why some of these constructions work.\n",
    "However, since schools teach things in different orders,\n",
    "showing why might rely on a few facts you have not learned yet.\n",
    "The next section goes over these facts."

    "A ruler is a straightedge, but a straightedge does not always have markings on it with which to measure distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **compass** is a tool used to draw circles.\n",
    "(Not to be confused with the other kind of compass used to determine direction.)\n",
    "One end of the compass has a sharp point.\n",
    "This point can be stuck into a surface so that that end does not move while drawing the circle.\n",
    "The other end holds a pencil.\n",
    "This end swings around to draw the circle while the other end stays still.\n",
    "The radius of the circle can be adjusted with a hinge at the top of the compass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word *congruent* means \"in agreement with\".\n",
    "In mathematics, we sometimes use the word congruent when things are very similar.\n",
    "Two triangles are **congruent** if you can get one triangle by sliding, rotating, or flipping the other triangle.\n",
    "It means that one triangle can be placed on top of the other triangle to make a perfect fit.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learned several geometric constructions:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Equilateral triangles\n",
    " * Angle bisectors\n",
    " * Perpendicular bisectors\n",
    " * Perpendicular lines\n",
    " * Parallel lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Each construction on this list can be done using constructions above it in the list.\n",
    "We assumed it was possible to draw perfect circles and lines using a compass and straightedge.\n",
    "Using circles and lines, we drew equilateral triangles.\n",
    "Using equilateral triangles (and circles and lines) we drew angle bisectors;\n",
    "with angle bisectors we drew perpendicular bisectors;\n",
    "with perpendicular bisectors, perpendicular lines;\n",
    "with perpendicular lines, parallel lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine how we can keep on going, making more and more things.\n",
    "These are just 5 of the 48 constructions and proofs in Euclid's first book.\n",
    "He continued for 12 more books.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some things that Euclid and the ancient Greeks could not do.\n",
    "They were able to bisect an angle, just like we did.\n",
    "However, using only a striaghtedge and compass, they were not able to cut any random angle into *three* equal pieces.\n",
    "(This is called \"trisecting\" an angle.)\n",
    "Given a triangle, they knew how to make a parallelogram with the same area as the triangle.\n",
    "Hoever, given a circle, they were not able to make a square with the same area as the circle.\n",
    "(This is called \"squaring the circle\".)\n",
    "It was only in the 1800's, more than 2000 years after Euclid, that these was proven to be *impossible*!\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most of mathematics is done much like how Euclid did geometry.\n",
    "Mathematicians start by assuming some basic facts.\n",
    "Then they use these to prove and do more and more sophisticated things.\n",
    "Because of this, you can ask \"Why?\" about almost anything in math,\n",
    "and there is a better answer than \"Just because.\"\n",
    "There is an answer to \"Why do the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees?\"\n",
    "In this notebook, we assumed it, but Euclid proved it.\n",
    "There is also an answer to \"Why is one bigger than zero?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## For More Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    " * [Euclid's *Elements*](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/Books/Euclid/Elements.pdf) Euclid wrote in Greek. Many translations of Euclid's books from Greek into English are freely available on the internet, including this one. <br>\n",
    " * [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Geometry](https://sciencevsmagic.net/geo/), a game where you have to construct the shapes in the corner, but you can only draw line segments and circles.<br>\n",
    " * [Euclid: The Game](https://kasperpeulen.github.io/), another geometry game where you have to construct shapes using only circles and lines. When you finish some constructions, you get to use them in later levels."
