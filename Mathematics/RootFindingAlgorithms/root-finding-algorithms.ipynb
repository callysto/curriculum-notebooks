    "In this notebook you will gain an understanding of basic root-finding algorithms and their implementation. This topic is introduced with the goal of easing you into numerical solutions to mathematical problems. We will outline the advantages and disadvantages of solving a problem numerically rather than analytically. At the end of the notebook there will be example problems, in which you have the opportunity to implement these methods, yielding a broader understanding of their applicability and power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Necessary background**:\n",
    "- Be able to factor quadratic polynomials\n",
    "- Understand basic python syntax\n",
    "- Read, graph, and analyze functions\n",
    "- Rudimentary algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook you will see examples of code to perform some basic root-finding algorithms. You will not be required to know how the code works or need to write any yourself. Nevertheless, you will be encouraged to manipulate some of the lines in order to input a function of your choice, but that is all. The pieces of code and algorithms can be simply thought of as tools to execute the task you want them to perform, and only running them will be a necessary to accomplish this task. Although the coding isn't required, I strongly encourage you to try to understand how and why it works. "

    "For a warm-up, we have created an exercise for you to determine the intervals on which a polynomial is $>$ 0. A first approach to this problem would be to find the roots of the polynomial and then analyze the behaviour in between these roots. We recommend converting the function into a form that you can graph in order to determine the behaviour on either side of the roots. Think about the possible forms of the graph, i.e. concavity, convexity, and what this tells you about the intervals where the function is positive. This type of analytical thinking will help further along in the notebook. </br>\n",

    "   Below we will outline the differences, pros and cons and methods of analytic vs. numerical solutions within the context of root finding. By solving for the roots of the polynomial and analyzing the graph of the function, you were able to explicitly determine an answer to the question posed. This is the benefit of these analytic expressions; they give you a nice and clear explicit answer. It is often the case that we can derive analytic solutions to simpler, well-posed problems. Now, what if the problem is not so well-posed? What if our analytic approach becomes way too complex or tedious? How would you approach this problem without finding zeroes? What if the polynomial is of $n^{\\rm th}$ order? For these cases we turn to a numerical approach, alleviating the work load and attaining the same end goal, but often with less accuracy.\n",

    "In order to answer the question, \"On what interval(s) is $ f(x) > 0?$\", you probably found the roots of the polynomial and looked at the behaviour of the graph in between these roots. This can be done for nice polynomials with integer coefficients and a low-order, but becomes increasingly difficult the more terms there are and the less simple the polynomials starts looking. Nevertheless, your initial approach to this problem can still be taken, i.e. find the roots and analyze the behaviour in between these roots in order to determine where $f(x)>$ 0. Below we will discuss some algorithms used to determine roots of a polynomial.\n",

    "A great advantage of utilizing a numerical approach is that it allows for quick ways to approximate a solution. This is useful if the amount of error is negligible and all one is looking for is an estimation. A quick way to get an estimation for our solution in question is simply to plot $f(x)$. This is similar to what you would do on your graphing calculator, now just on the computer using code! If you would like to get started plotting with python, the best place to start is with matplotlib. It's quick to learn, if you know basic python syntax, and there are tons of internet resources to explore its capabilities and debug problems. For extensive documentation and functionality of the matplotlib library see https://matplotlib.org/. Click on plot function to inspect $f(x)$ above.\n"

The basic idea of the method is to initially take an interval, $[a,b]$ over which a function $f$ is continuous, such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have different signs (so you know that there is a root in between). We then split the interval into two and check the new endpoints of each subinterval. Let $c = (a+b)/2$ be the midpoint of the interval. If the function values at the endpoints of one of these two subintervals have identical signs (that is, if $f(a)$ and $f(c)$ have the same signs or $f(b)$ and $f(c)$ have the same signs) then this subinterval is discarded, knowing that a root must lie within the other subinterval. Note that a root could also exist within the other interval but it is not guaranteed. We then divide this subinterval into two and repeat the same analysis on it. Eventually, up to an accuracy that we are happy with, we will have a small interval within which a root is found. \n",

    "for i in range(1,n):\n",

    "also deserves some explanation. This is another essential programming tool known as the *for loop*. Within the `for` statement, the indented code block is executed, then the next iteration of the loop is performed, in our case $i \\mapsto i+1$, and this continues until all iterations are done ($i = n$). It provides a means of counting or iterating through a process. In our case these are the iterations of the secant method. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The `print(x1)` statement is outside of the indented block. This means that x1 is printed after the loop has finished. If the statement were included within the block, then x1 would be every time (how many times would x1 be printed?).\n",

    "Below is a visualization of the algorithm at work. Input the initial values of $x_0$ and $x_1$ below and press \"Iterate\" to see how the algorithm searches for the roots of the same function used in the \"Inspection\" example. This will give you a sense how this algorithm works and the problems it may run into. Reset the cell by pressing restart and playing around with different initial conditions to gain a better sense of how the algorithm works. Does it seem faster than the bisection method? How many iterations are required until it converges to the solution with the accuracy you wanted? Did it even converge? Notice how different initial guesses can make the algorithm converge to different roots.\n",

With appropriate guesses for the initial conditions, we would be able to obtain all roots (in theory) but this would be a tedious task.

Namely, we studied the process of finding and approximating the roots of a function by inspection, the bisection method,and the secant method. Equally as important, you gained some experience and exposure (if you haven't seen some already) to scientific computing. \n",

It is likely that this is the first time you have been exposed to transcendental equations and the methods we have discussed here. Hopefully, working through the notebook helped you understand the different ways in which one can break down a problem like this. Which did you like best? Being able to adapt and apply the mathematical tools that you have acquired in class is an invaluable skill to have. These skills often end up transferring to general problem-solving skills. I encourage you to reflect upon which of the methods you enjoyed and why. It will offer insight into your own personal learning process.\n"
