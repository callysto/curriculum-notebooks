    "# Constructing the musical scale\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have discovered two important facts about how we hear and interpret musical notes. We will call them axioms because they are fundamental to our task of constructing the music scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Axiom 1** The ear compares different frequencies *multiplicatively* rather than *additively*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Axiom 2** Two notes of different frequency sound “good” together when the ratio of their frequencies can be expressed as a quotient of two small integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay––let’s construct a musical scale. Now what do I mean by that? Recall that a note is a certain frequency of oscillation. There are an infinite number of possible frequencies available, so we need to pick out a certain finite subset and agree that these will be the notes to “use” (tune our instruments to) when we play music. But which ones shall we pick and what properties do we want the scale to have?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of ways to make a scale, in fact different solutions have been adopted by cultures througout history. The system we use now has dominated Western culture for 500 years, and that suggests that it might just have something going for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system we’ve grouped notes into octaves each with 12 notes, and the frequencies in each octave are twice those in the previous octave. In the table of frequencies generated by the code below, each row is an octave."
