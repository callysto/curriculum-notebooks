Clamp the string down in the middle and vibrate it to get the first note. Then clamp it one third the way along and vibrate it again. The two frequencies are in the ratio 3:2. Can you explain why this is the case? If not, do a bit of research around this question. Now take 4/3, what would you do to the string to produce two frequencies in that ratio?"

    "The system of having a constant frequency ratio between successive notes (which we are pursuing here) is called **even temperament**, and that‚Äôs the scheme that western music has adopted. Because of the homogeneity of the scale, all keys are equally good, in the sense that any two will have the same relative intervals between pairs of notes. To popularize this Bach wrote a series of 24 preludes and fugues (12 major keys and 12 minor keys) called The [Well-Tempered Clavier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Well-Tempered_Clavier).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the **acoustic scale** would require that the 8 notes in any ‚Äúkey‚Äù be the correct small integers ratios and for the key of C major these are given, along with the corresponding decimals, in the table below. The problem with this is that what‚Äôs right in one key won‚Äôt usually be right in another and some pieces, when transposed, will sound awful.\n",
