    "# 14.3 Tidal period and sideral day\n",

    "The second major reason that high tides don't happen twice every 24 hours is that there are two kinds of day lengths. Our standard interpretation of the day is what is called the *solar day* because it’s determined with reference to the sun, this is 24 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other kind of day is called the *sidereal day*, it’s the time required for the earth to rotate through 360°. It can be defined for any rotating body whether it has a sun or not; in a sense its reference is the rest of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires a minor correction to our previous calculations."

    "Suppose we are above the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun (again with the north pole pointing up). Draw a line between the centres of the sun and the earth and take t = 0 to be a moment at which that line intersects the surface of the earth at the zero meridian of longitude (coloured red). Now let the earth rotate exactly 360° and draw that line again (between the two centres).\n",
    "![Earth rotating 360 while revolving through arc](images/earth-sun-rotation-1.png)\n",
    "The line doesn't pass through the zero meridian, the earth needs to rotate a little more (since it is rotating counter-clockwise and revolving counter-clockwise). That 360° plus a little more takes 24 hours.\n",
    "![Earth rotating 360 plus a bit for 24 hours](images/earth-sun-rotation-2.png)\n",
