    "### Effects of Outliers \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mean\n",
    "From the above results and histogram, we see that adding outliers can change the mean dramatically.<br>\n",
    "This is because we need to add all the values to determine the mean value.<br>\n",
    "Outliers are often values that are much larger or smaller than the other values.<br>\n",
    "When we add these values to the sum, the average can change a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Median\n",
    "For the median, we need to consider the middle number(s).<br>\n",
    "Adding one outlier adds a single point at the far end of our data set, so everything else shifts over only one spot. <br>\n",
    "The median might change or might not.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mode\n",
    "The mode is very unlikely to change, because mode is the most repeated value.<br>\n",
    "Unless you add many outliers, all with the same value, the mode probably won't change.<br>\n",
    "And if there are multiple outliers with the same value, then maybe they should be kept in the dataset, they might be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What should we use to represent data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we use central tendency is to tell important information about the data set we want to talk about. We want to know what this data is like without saying every value in the set. Usually mean is used to represent data as it is affected by all points, but that's not always a good thing. If there's an outlier in the data, maybe mean is not the best way to represent the middle of the data in general. Median might be a more truthful representation of the middle in that case. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the food data, we might want to represent how much sodium is in food we eat nearly every day. If we don't eat soy sauce often, then it would be an outlier. Then the mean will tell us we eat a lot more sodium every day than the median would tell us. If we use the mean to represent this data, someone could argue that we eat too much sodium. But its not true since we don't eat it often. So if we use the median to represent this data, we can still include soy sauce in the data, but it would represent what we eat more truthfully."
