The numbers in the brackets are the starting number, the final number, and the number of points between the two. In this case, we create a list of 1000 numbers equally spaced between `-10` and `10`. We will define this list as the variable `x` by typing `x=` before we call the `numpy` function:\n",

We can enter arguments in the brackets to specify the size of the figure window to make it easier to read. To actually draw the graph, we call `plot(x,y)`, draws the graph of y as a function of x.\n",
