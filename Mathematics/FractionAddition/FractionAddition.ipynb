    "# Adding Fractions\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "A **fraction** is a *number*, but not necessarily a whole number.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A fraction is written in the form $\\dfrac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, with $b\\neq 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number $a$ (on top) is called the **numerator** and the number $b$ (on the bottom) is called the **denominator**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fractions are used to represent parts of a whole \"object\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator $b$ tells us the number of equal parts an object is divided into.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator $a$ tells us how many of those parts we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a pizza is divided into 8 equal slices, and I eat 3 of them, then I've eaten $\\dfrac{3}{8}$ of a pizza.\n",
    "\n",
    "![3/8th pizza](./images/38Pizza.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many cases where it is useful to add or subtract two fractions. <br>\n",
    "Let's take Kevin as an example. He had two large pizzas at his birthday party: one pepperoni and one deluxe.<br>\n",
    "Each pizza was cut into 8 slices. If there are 3 slices of pepperoni pizza and 6 slices of deluxe pizza left over, how much pizza is left over in total? <br>\n",
    "What if the deluxe pizza was cut into 12 slices instead of 8? <br>\n",
    "These are examples where we must add two fractions to solve the problem. <br>\n",

    "### Fractions (Quick Recap)\n",
    "A fraction is a number that represents part of something.\n",
    "![Fraction](./images/numDenom.png)\n",
    "For example, the fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$ represents half of the integer 1. In other words, $0.5$. <br>\n",
    "Statements like $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{16}{32}$ can sometimes confuse people because it is not always easy to see how $1$ might relate to $16$ or how $2$ might relate to $32$, but in reality they both simply mean *one half*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to say $\\frac{1}{2}$ is to say $1$ *divided by* $2$. <br>\n",
    "As a little exercise, try inputting $1\\div 2$ into a calculator, then try $16 \\div 32$.<br>\n",
    "Did you get the same answer both times?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Half](./images/calculatorHalf.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try another one, input $1 \\div 4$, then try $77 \\div 308$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Quarter](./images/calculatorQuarter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is really happening is that the bottom number (the denominator) tells you how many equal parts the object is divided into, and the top number (the numerator) tells you how many of these equal parts we actually have. So for example if we cut a large pizza into $2$ slices and take $1$, or if we cut the same large pizza into $32$ slices and take $16$, we took the same amount of pizza in both cases, $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ (a half of the pizza) \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main categories when talking about fractions: proper, improper, and mixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **proper fraction** is one where the numerator is less than the denominator, and it represents a number between 0 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "An **improper fraction** is one where the numerator is larger than or equal to the denominator, and it represents a number greater than or equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **mixed number** is the sort of thing you might encounter in carpentry or a baking recipe, like $3\\,\\frac14$ inches (it's like saying $3+\\frac14$), or $1\\,\\frac12$ cups of flour ($1+\\frac12$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed numbers and improper fractions are two different ways of expressing the same number, and it is possible to [convert between them](https://www.mathsisfun.com/improper-fractions.html)."

    "Now that we have a better understanding of how to add fractions with like denominators, letâ€™s look at our pizza example from earlier. Kevin had two large pizzas at his birthday party: one pepperoni and one deluxe.\n",
    "Each pizza was cut into 8 slices. If there are 3 slices of pepperoni pizza and 6 slices of deluxe pizza left over, how much pizza is left over in total? <br>\n",

    "- **Proper fractions** represent a number between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "- **Improper fractions** represent a number greater than or equal to $1$.\n",
    "- Unlike fractions require the same denominator before adding or subtracting.\n",
    "- Multiplying the top and bottom part of the fractions until we get a common denominator.\n",
    "- When adding or subtracting fractions, only the numerators are added or subtracted. The denominator remains the same.\n",

    "So it turns out fractions are not so scary after all! They simply represent a number between $0$ and $1$ or a number greater than $1$. With a little practice adding and subtracting fractions, you will become a fraction guru in no time!"
