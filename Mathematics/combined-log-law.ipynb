    "Logarithms are the inverse operation to exponentials. They are useful because they change the arithmetic operations of multiplication, division, and powers into addition, subtraction, and products. While modern calculators can do all these operations quickly, for us mere humans logarithms can be useful for doing quick approximations in our heads."

    "Going about our day, we often run into powers of ten, when we see kilograms of food in a grocery store (1000 grams), megawatts of power from an electrical generator (1,000,000 watts) or gigabytes of memory in our computer (1,000,000,000 bytes). It is the **power** of ten that is important, and the logarithm captures this idea with the formulats\n",

    "\n",
    "For numbers that aren't integer powers of 10, the logarithm is still defined by the above formula, where $n$ can be any real number solving $x = 10^n$. For instance, you might guess that $\\log(5000)$ is somewhere between 3 and 4, since the number 5000 is halfway between $10^3 = 1000$ and $10^4 = 10,000$.

    "\n",
    "### Mathematical proof\n",
    "Let's create a proof of the Quotient law.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, fix quantities $x$ and $y$ and define the values \n",

    "which completes the proof of the Quotient Law.\n",

    "### Graphical Demonstration\n",
    "As we know, the Quotient Law states: $\\log_{B}x+\\log_{B}y = \\log_{B}(x \\times y).$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To go about this, we introduce a parameter $t$ that allows us to trace the graph of the logarithm function. We will also introduce two constant integers, $m$ and $n$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We let $x=mt$ and $y=nt$ and set the base $B$ to 10, abbreviating $\\log_{10}(x)$ as $\\log(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these values of $x$ and $y$, the product law becomes  \n",

When looking at a $t$ value, the difference of the corresponding values of the functions on the left side of the equation should be equivalent to the function on the right side of the equation, thus providing a demonstration of the Quotient Law.\n"

    "### Result\n",
    "In the mathematical proof, we  used the relationship between logarithms and exponents as well as exponential laws in order to derive the Quotient Law. When we look at the graphical demonstration, we see that the functions on the right hand side both resemble very similar curves. On the left hand side of the law, we can see that the function remains as a constant number. We also see that the left-hand side of the law is equivalent to the difference to the two functions on the right-hand side."

    "In this case, there is one function on each the left and right hand sides of the law. For this reason 2 functions will be graphed. Since they are theoretically be equivalent to each other, we can expect that the functions will be identical on the graph. If this is seen on the graph, we can validate Power Law.\n",

    "As we know, the power Law states: $\\log_B(x^p) = p \\times \\log_B(x).$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To go about this, we introduce a parameter $t$ that allows us to trace the graph of the logarithm function. We will also introduce a constant interger, $m$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We let $x=mt$ and set the base $B$ to 10, abbreviating $\\log{10}(x)$ as $\\log(x)$.\n",

    "For the graphical demonstration, we will graph the three terms in the above equation separately with respect to $t$. When looking at a $t$ value, the function on the left side of the equation should be equivalent to the function on the right side of the equation, thus providing a demonstration of the power law."
