    "One topic we may hear in the news that uses odds and probability is that of lottery winners. According to CBC, approximately a quarter of all Canadians play the lottery weekly. We can buy a ticket and choose three sets of seven numbers for $5.00. Now, how do we calculate the odds of winning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider [Lotto Max](http://lotto.bclc.com/lotto-max-and-extra/prizes-and-odds.html). In this lottery game, the player selects 7 distinct numbers from 1 to 49. We can count the number of ways to do this by using the  _Choose Function_ (Also known as the [Binomial Coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient)). This gives us the number of ways to choose $k$ non-ordered elements from a fixed set of $n$ elements, which we write as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$${n \\choose k} = {n! \\over {k!(n-k)!}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $n$ and $k$ are both positive integers and $n!$ means $n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdots 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1$, (Some positive integer $n$ multiplied by every positive integer less than it). Now, back to the lottery. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have $k=7$ numbers to choose from a total of $n=49$ numbers. The number of ways to do this is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${49 \\choose 7} = {49! \\over {7!(49-7)!}} = {49! \\over {7!42!}} = {49\\cdot 48\\cdot 47\\cdot 46\\cdot 45\\cdot 44\\cdot 43\\cdot 42! \\over {7!42!}} = {49\\cdot 48\\cdot 47\\cdot 46\\cdot 45\\cdot 44\\cdot 43 \\over {7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1}} = 85,900,584$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To win the lottery, we must hold a winning ticket, where one of the sets of numbers we chose matches all 7 of the winning numbers. Note that there is exactly one set of such set of winning numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a $5.00 ticket allows us to choose three sets of seven numbers, our chances of winning are slightly better. This is assuming that we don't choose exactly the same seven numbers for two or three of our sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have three of the possible $85,900,584$ seven number configurations. This makes the odds for holding a winning ticket as $3:85,900,584$, (Or $1:28,633,528$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploration:** Every ticket comes with three sets of seven numbers we can choose from. We saw that the odds of having a winning ticket is $3:85,900,584$, (Or $1:28,633,528$ simplified). If we had only one set of seven numbers to choose from in a single ticket, the odds of winning would be much lower -  $1:85,900,584$. So, in comparing having one set of number to having 3 sets of numbers, our chances seem to have improved. \n",

    "In this Jupyter Notebook by Callysto, you learned about assessing the validity of odds and probability statements. We first outlined the concepts of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Events*, \n",
    "* *Probability*, \n",
    "* And *Odds*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thereafter, we defined some commonly used types of odds:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Odds on*,\n",
    "* *Odds against*, \n",
    "* And *Even odds*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learnt the differences between *Dependent* and *Independent events*. We also elucidated the perspectives of Bayesian and Frequentist reasoning. These two schools of thought, along with an understanding of the concepts outlined throughout this Notebook, will give the reader a necessary toolset to interpret and assess the validity of odds and probability statements."
