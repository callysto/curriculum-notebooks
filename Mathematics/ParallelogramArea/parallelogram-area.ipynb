    "This notebook will help you understand how to find the area of a parallelogram, and give a few practice questions. This one notebook wonâ€™t be enough practice to master this skill, so you'll need to do lots of practice. A parallelogram is a special type of *quadrilateral* -- a shape with four sides. There are many different types of quadrilateral, as shown below:\n",

    "Let's review what we've learned in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The area of a parallelogram is the same as the area of a rectangle with the same base and height.\n",
    "- The formula is $\\text{Area} = \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$\n",
    "- The formula works for all types of parallelograms as long as you know base and height.\n",
    "- The formula works for finding any variable that is missing by rearranging values on either side of the equals sign.\n",

    "Take the time to learn this formula and how to fill it in. You may not always have the formula to read, but filling in and manipulating equations like this formula will be essential for many math skills in the future. As always in mathematics, the more you practice, the easier it gets!"
