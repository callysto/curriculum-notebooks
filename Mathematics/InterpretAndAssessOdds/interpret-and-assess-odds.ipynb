Having a clear understanding of these definitions will help with the rest of the notebook, as these concepts will be used often. \n","\n","**Event:** An outcome of an experiment. These are the outcomes that are possible. \n","\n","For example, when rolling a die, the possible events are the die landing on the numbers $1-6$.\n","\n","**Probability:**\n","The likelihood that an event will occur. In a very large amount of trials, it is the fraction of times you expect the event to happen. This is expressed as a number between $0$ and $1$ or as a percent.\n","\n","For example, after a large number of coin flips you would expect heads half of the time. Therefore the probability of heads is $0.5$ or $50$%.\n","\n","**Odds:**\n","The odds of an event can be expressed as a ratio of the probability that the event *will* occur to the probability that it *will not* occur. \n","\n","For example, what are the odds of rolling a $1$ for a fair die? \n","\n","Well, the probability of rolling a $1$ is $(\\frac{1}{6})$ and the probability of not rolling a $1$ is $1-(\\frac{1}{6}) = (\\frac{5}{6})$ . Therefore the odds are:\n","     \n","$\\frac{1}{6}:\\frac{5}{6} = 1:5$\n","\n","**Note**: You can also express the probability of an event *not* happening as: $1-p$, where $p$ is the probability of the event occurring."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"hidden":false},"source":["## Converting between Odds and Probability\n","\n","\n","Now that we understand what odds and probabilities mean, we can look at how they are related. We can also look at how we can express one as the other. \n","\n","To describe odds in favour of an event $E$, we have to think about what we are writing a ratio of. We are writing the ratio of $E$ happening versus that of $E$ not happening. This we write as $P(E)$ and $1-P(E)$ respectively.\n","\n","We can write this as an equation:\n","\n","$$\\text{Odds for the event $E$ occurring} = {P(E) \\over 1-P(E)}$$\n","\n","As a ratio, we would write this as $P(E):1-P(E).$  \n","\n","If the odds are $r:s$ in favour of an event $E$, we write this as:\n","$$\\text{Odds for the event $E$ occurring} = \\displaystyle { ({r \\over s}) \\over {1 + ({r \\over s}) } }.$$\n","\n","However, if the odds are against the event $E$ occurring, we would write the equation:\n","\n","$$\\text{Odds against the event $E$ occurring} = {1-P(E) \\over P(E)}$$\n","\n","As a ratio, we would write this as $1-P(E):P(E).$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"hidden":false},"source":["## Dartboard Virtual Experiment\n","\n","Consider the dartboard simulation below.

According to the CBC, approximately a quarter of all Canadians play the lottery weekly. We can buy a ticket and choose three sets of seven numbers for $5.00. Now, how do we calculate the odds of winning?\n","\n","Consider [Lotto Max](http://lotto.bclc.com/lotto-max-and-extra/prizes-and-odds.html). In this lottery game, the player selects 7 distinct numbers from 1 to 49. We can count the number of ways to do this by using the  _Choose Function_ (Also known as the [Binomial Coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient)). This gives us the number of ways to choose $k$ non-ordered elements from a fixed set of $n$ elements, which we write as follows: \n","\n","$${n \\choose k} = {n! \\over {k!(n-k)!}}$$\n","\n","Here, $n$ and $k$ are both positive integers and $n!$ means $n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdots 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1$, (Some positive integer $n$ multiplied by every positive integer less than it). Now, back to the lottery. \n","\n","We have $k=7$ numbers to choose from a total of $n=49$ numbers. The number of ways to do this is given by:\n","\n","$${49 \\choose 7} = {49! \\over {7!(49-7)!}} = {49! \\over {7!42!}} = {49\\cdot 48\\cdot 47\\cdot 46\\cdot 45\\cdot 44\\cdot 43\\cdot 42! \\over {7!42!}} = {49\\cdot 48\\cdot 47\\cdot 46\\cdot 45\\cdot 44\\cdot 43 \\over {7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1}} = 85,900,584$$\n","\n","To win the lottery, we must hold a winning ticket, where one of the sets of numbers we chose matches all 7 of the winning numbers. Note that there is exactly one set of winning numbers.\n","\n","Since a $5.00 ticket allows us to choose three sets of seven numbers, our chances of winning are slightly better. This is assuming that we don't choose exactly the same seven numbers for two or three of our sets.\n","\n","So, we have three of the possible $85,900,584$ seven number configurations. This makes the odds for holding a winning ticket as $3:85,900,584$, (Or $1:28,633,528$).\n","\n","**Exploration:** Every ticket comes with three sets of seven numbers we can choose from. We saw that the odds of having a winning ticket is $3:85,900,584$, (Or $1:28,633,528$ simplified). If we had only one set of seven numbers to choose from in a single ticket, the odds of winning would be much lower: $1:85,900,584$. So, in comparing having one set of numbers to having three sets of numbers, our chances seem to have improved."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"hidden":false},"source":["## Conclusion\n","\n","In this Jupyter notebook we learned about assessing the validity of odds and probability statements.
