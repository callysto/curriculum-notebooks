Let's begin with some definitions.\n","\n","**Event:** An outcome of an experiment. These are all the outcomes that are possible. \n","\n","For example, when rolling a die, the possible events are the die landing on number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n","\n","**Probability:**\n","The likelihood that an event will occur. In a very large amount of trials, it is the fraction of times you expect the event to happen. This is expressed as a number between $0$ and $1$ or as a percent.\n","\n","For example, after a large number of coin flips you would expect heads half of the time. Therefore the probability of heads is $0.5$ or $50$%.\n","\n","**Odds:**\n","The odds of an event can be expressed as a ratio of the probability that the event *will* occur to the probability that it *will not* occur. \n","\n","For example, what are the odds of rolling a $1$ with a fair die? \n","\n","Well, the probability of rolling a $1$ is $(\\frac{1}{6})$ and the probability of not rolling a $1$ is $1-(\\frac{1}{6}) = (\\frac{5}{6})$ . Therefore the odds are:\n","     \n","$\\frac{1}{6}:\\frac{5}{6} = 1:5$\n","\n","**Note**: You can also express the probability of an event *not* happening as $1-P(E)$, where $P(E)$ is the probability of the event occurring.\n","\n","## Converting between Odds and Probability\n","\n","To describe odds in favour of an event $E$, we have to think about what we are writing a ratio of. We are writing the probability of $E$ happening as a ratio of $E$ not happening.\n","\n","We write this as\n","\n","$P(E):1-P(E)$\n","\n","or\n","\n","$\\frac{P(E)}{1-P(E)}$\n","\n","Odds against $E$ happening could be written as $1-P(E):P(E)$.\n","\n","## Dartboard Virtual Experiment\n","\n","Consider the dartboard simulation below. If a dart is thrown at random, what are the odds on it hitting inside the green circle? This can simulate throwing up to 100,000 darts."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"hidden":false},"outputs":[],"source":["import random\n","import ipywidgets as widgets\n","from IPython.display import display, Markdown, clear_output\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","darts_number=widgets.BoundedIntText(value=100,min=0,max=100000,step=100,disabled=False)\n","submit_button3=widgets.Button(description='Throw',button_style='info',disabled=False)\n","\n","def on_button_submit3_clicked(b):\n","    clear_output()\n","    display(widgets.HBox([darts_number,submit_button3]))\n","    circle_centerx=1\n","    circle_centery=1\n","    circle_radius=0.5\n","    x_green=[]\n","    y_green=[]\n","    x_inside=[]\n","    y_inside=[]\n","    x_outside=[]\n","    y_outside=[]\n","    for i in range(darts_number.value):\n","        x=random.random()*2\n","        y=random.random()*2\n","        if (x-circle_centerx)**2+(y-circle_centery)**2<circle_radius**2:\n","            x_green.append(x)\n","            y_green.append(y)\n","        elif (x-circle_centerx)**2+(y-circle_centery)**2<(circle_radius*2)**2:\n","            x_inside.append(x)\n","            y_inside.append(y)\n","        else:\n","            x_outside.append(x)\n","            y_outside.append(y)\n","\n","    circle1 = plt.Circle((circle_centerx, circle_centery), circle_radius,color='green',fill=False)\n","    circle2 = plt.Circle((circle_centerx, circle_centery), circle_radius*2,color='black',fill=False)\n","    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))\n","    ax.plot(x_green,y_green, 'o', color='g',alpha=0.4)\n","    ax.plot(x_inside,y_inside, 'o', color='y',alpha=0.4)\n","    ax.plot(x_outside,y_outside, 'o', color='r',alpha=0.4)\n","    ax.add_artist(circle2)\n","    ax.add_artist(circle1)\n","    plt.ylim(0, 2)\n","    plt.xlim(0, 2)\n","    plt.show()\n","\n","    dartboard_percent = '{:.1f}'.format(100*(len(x_green)+len(x_inside))/darts_number.value)\n","    green_circle_percent_of_board = '{:.1f}'.format(100*len(x_green)/(len(x_green)+len(x_inside)))\n","    green_circle_percent_of_total = '{:.1f}'.format(100*len(x_green)/darts_number.value)\n","    display(Markdown(\"Darts that hit the dartboard: \"+str(len(x_green)+len(x_inside))+\" (\"+dartboard_percent+\"%)\"))\n","    display(Markdown(\"Darts inside the green circle: \"+str(len(x_green))+\" (\"+green_circle_percent_of_board+\"%, or \"+green_circle_percent_of_total+\"% of total)\"))\n","\n","submit_button3.on_click(on_button_submit3_clicked)\n","display(Markdown(\"**Number of darts to throw** (up to 100000):\"))\n","display(widgets.HBox([darts_number,submit_button3]))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["For this problem we need to calculate the areas of the inner and outer circles, calculate the probability, and then the odds.\n","\n","If $r_1=1$ is the radius of the inner (green) circle and $r_2=2$ is the radius of the dartboard (the outer circle), we can calculate the probability of a dart thrown at random will land within the inner circle."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from math import pi\n","def circle_area(r):\n","    return pi*r**2\n","\n","rectangle_area = 2*2\n","inner_circle_area = circle_area(0.5)\n","outer_circle_area = circle_area(1)\n","print('Inner circle probability:', '{:.2f}'.format(100*inner_circle_area/rectangle_area)+'%')\n","print('Outer circle probability:', '{:.2f}'.format(100*outer_circle_area/rectangle_area)+'%')\n","print('Inner circle odds:', inner_circle_area/outer_circle_area, 'or', (inner_circle_area/outer_circle_area).as_integer_ratio())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"hidden":false},"source":["Use the dartboard virtual experiment to see if there is a convergence towards 1:4 after 100 darts, or perhaps 10000.\n","\n","## Making Decisions Based on Odds & Probability\n","\n","[According to the CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/lotto-max-announces-changes-1.5136125), approximately three quarters of Canadians bought lottery tickets in a year.
