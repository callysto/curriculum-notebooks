    "# Interpret and Assess Probability and Odds\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook we will look at examples of probability and odds calculations. Let's begin with some definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event:** An outcome of an experiment. These are all the outcomes that are possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when rolling a die, the possible events are the die landing on number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability:**\n",
    "The likelihood that an event will occur. In a very large amount of trials, it is the fraction of times you expect the event to happen. This is expressed as a number between $0$ and $1$ or as a percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, after a large number of coin flips you would expect heads half of the time. Therefore the probability of heads is $0.5$ or $50$%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Odds:**\n",
    "The odds of an event can be expressed as a ratio of the probability that the event *will* occur to the probability that it *will not* occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what are the odds of rolling a $1$ with a fair die? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the probability of rolling a $1$ is $(\\frac{1}{6})$ and the probability of not rolling a $1$ is $1-(\\frac{1}{6}) = (\\frac{5}{6})$ . Therefore the odds are:\n",
    "     \n",
    "$\\frac{1}{6}:\\frac{5}{6} = 1:5$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You can also express the probability of an event *not* happening as $1-P(E)$, where $P(E)$ is the probability of the event occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting between Odds and Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe odds in favour of an event $E$, we have to think about what we are writing a ratio of. We are writing the probability of $E$ happening as a ratio of $E$ not happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write this as\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(E):1-P(E)$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{P(E)}{1-P(E)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Odds against $E$ happening could be written as $1-P(E):P(E)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dartboard Virtual Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the dartboard simulation below. If a dart is thrown at random, what are the odds on it hitting inside the green circle? Click on the following code cell, then click the `‚èµRun` button to simulate throwing darts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the number of darts in the cell to something like `number_of_darts = 1000` and see what difference it makes. This can simulate throwing up to 100,000 darts."
