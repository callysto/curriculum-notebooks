    "# Statistics Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you will collect numerical data on a topic of interest, perform statistical analysis, report findings in a Jupyter notebook, and be ready to explain results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Creating an Action Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a research question on a statistical topic you would like to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions to consider when selecting a topic:\n",
    "* Is the topic interesting?\n",
    "* Can you find enough data to do a statistical analysis?\n",
    "* Is there an important issue related to the topic?\n",
    "* Will your audience appreciate your presentation?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may choose a topic where you collect the data yourself through surveys, interviews, or direct observations (*primary data*) **or** where you use data that has already been collected from other sources (*secondary data*).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* To make sure that you have enough data to perform a statistical analysis, **you must collect at least 100 values**. If you are collecting your own data, and it involves surveying people, please note that if you collect any [personally identifiable information](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda_brief/#_h2) such as age and name then you'll need to get people's consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ideas for Primary Data Topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* People's physical characteristics: height, shoe size, etc.\n",
    "* Family size, number of children in a family, the time separation between siblings, age\n",
    "difference between mother and father\n",
    "* Number in a household of: pets, TV’s, books, mobile devices, vehicles, etc.\n",
    "* Number of mobile devices that a person has owned\n",
    "* Number of hours of television watched in a day or week\n",
    "* Number of songs on a person’s playlist\n",
    "* Number of hours on the phone in a day or week\n",
    "* Number of text messages sent in a day or week\n",
    "* Mass of apples or any other type of produce\n",
    "* The number of items of your favourite product sold in a day (contact local retailers)\n",
    "* The length (time or distance) of a person's commute to school or work\n",
    "* The length of a poet’s poems (either by lines or words)\n",
    "* The size of classes\n",
    "* The number or percentage of each gender in classes\n",
    "* How long people can keep their eyes open or stand on one foot\n",
    "* Number of people on the different school clubs or sports teams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose this type of data, please make sure your research question is well-defined. As well, the dataset you use must contain at least 100 values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to do a comparison in order to get enough information to perform a statistical analysis. For example, compare climate in provinces or compare career stats of two or more hockey players.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ideas for Secondary Data Topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are a number of starter notebooks for secondary data in the [AccessingData](AccessingData) folder.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to choose a topic that is not in that list, but keep in mind that you need to find enough data for your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Your Research Question or Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A good question requires thought and planning. A well-written research question or statement clarifies exactly what your project is designed to do. It should have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The research topic is easily identifiable and the purpose of the research is clear.\n",
    "* The question/statement is focused. The people who are listening to or reading the question/statement will know what you are going to be researching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating Your Research Question or Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does the question or statement clearly identify the main objective of the research?\n",
    "* Are you confident that the question or statement will lead you to sufficient and approprate data to reach a conclusion?\n",
    "* Can you use the statistical methods you learned in class to analyze the data?\n",
    "* Is the question or statement interesting? Does it make you want to learn more?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a research question for your topic.\n",
    "* Decide if you will use primary data, secondary data, or both. Explain how you made your decision.\n",
    "* Use the above checklist to evaluate your question. Adjust your question as needed.\n",
    "* Make a plan to collect your data.\n",
    "* Be prepared to discuss with your teacher your research question and your plan for collecting or finding the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Carrying Out Your Research\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collect the data. There is a sheet at the back of this booklet for you to record your data.\n",
    "* If using primary data, describe your data collection method or methods.\n",
    "* If using secondary data, record detailed information about your source(s) so that you can cite them in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Analyzing Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose which statistical tools are most applicable to your topic. Some tools may work well, others may not be applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* data tables\n",
    "* visualization(s) (e.g. Histogram, Frequency Polygon, Scatterplot)\n",
    "* measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)\n",
    "* measures of dispersion (range and standard deviation)\n",
    "* outliers (Are there outliers in your data? Do these skew the results? Would it be more appropriate to remove the outliers before calculating measures of central tendency or dispersion?)\n",
    "* normal distribution, standard deviation, and z-scores (Does your data approximate a normal distribution? Explain why or why not.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4: The Final Product and Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a notebook or slide presentation, including visuals, to share your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "[Income Per Person](example-project-income-per-person.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Soccer Data](example-project-soccer.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating Your Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible questions to ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did I define my topic well?\n",
    "* Is my project or presentation focused?\n",
    "* Did I organize information effectively?\n",
    "* What might make my project more effective?\n",
    "* What unanswered questions might my audience have?\n",
