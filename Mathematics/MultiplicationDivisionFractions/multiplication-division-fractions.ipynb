    "### How do we divide using fractions?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know how to multiply fractions, then you already know how to divide fractions! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to dividing integers,or whole numbers. We know that 10 divided by 2 is 5, because 10 can be split into 2 portions each of which has 5. Now notice that dividing 10 by 2 is the same as taking half of 10. That is,\n",
    "$$\\hskip-60pt 10\\div 2 = 10\\times \\frac12 = 5.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the equality $10 \\div 2 = 10\\times\\frac{1}{2}$, we took the reciprocal of the second number ($\\frac{2}{1} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}$) then changed the division to multiplication! What is the reciprocal? It's when the old numerator becomes the new denominator and the old denominator becomes the new numerator!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's how division with fractions works too: flip the divisor, the number after the division, and then multiply! \n",
    "\n",
    "## The golden rule of division: *division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal*\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what is $10\\div \\frac{1}{3}$? If we apply the rule we just came up with, we find\n",
    "$$\\hskip-60pt 10\\div \\frac13 = 10\\times\\frac31 = 10\\times 3 = 30.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this make sense? Recall that when we compute $10\\div 2=5$, what we're working out is the number of groups of 2 we need to make 10. Similarly, the expression $10\\div \\frac13$ is asking how many $\\frac{1}{3}$ pieces can fit into 10 pieces. Since it takes 3 $\\frac{1}{3}$s to make one and 10 ones to make 10, we need $3\\times 10 = 30$ pieces of size $\\frac{1}{3}$ to make 10, therefore $10 \\div \\frac{1}{3} = 10 \\times 3 = 30$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here are the steps\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1:\n",
    "Find the reciprocal of the divisor. (By making the numerator the denominator and the denominator the numerator of the second fraction.)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### But why does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that division is the opposite of multiplication: dividing by a number \"undoes\" multiplication by that same number. This has a special name, division is the *inverse operation* of multiplication. Here, we are interested in undoing multiplication by fractions. Let's start with an integer example. Consider the multiplication of 10 by 4: $10 \\times 4 = 40$. To undo the multiplication by 4, we divide by 4: $40 \\div 4 = 10$ and we get back to the original number! Same goes for fractions: consider the product $20 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 10$. Dividing by $\\frac12$ should undo the multiplication. Our rule for division says that to divide by $\\frac{1}{2}$, we multiply by $\\frac21 = 2$: $10 \\div \\frac{1}{2} = 10\\times 2 = 20$. Once again, we get back to the original number!\n",
    "\n",
    "If dividing by 4 is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{1}{4}$, then it's true that dividing by $\\frac{1}{4}$ is equivalent to multiplying by 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if you flip the first number instead of the second? Try it with an example we've already solved. Does it change the answer or does the order not matter like multiplication?\n",
    "\n",
    "### But isn't division supposed to make the number smaller?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is, \"Yes, but only if the number we're dividing by is bigger than 1.\" Try thinking of division as repeated subtraction: $2 \\div \\frac{1}{2}$ is asking how many times can we subtract $\\frac{1}{2}$ from 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hskip-60pt \\begin{align*}\n",
    "2 - \\frac{1}{2} &= 1\\frac{1}{2}\\tag{once}\\\\[5pt]\n",
    "1\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} &= 1\\tag{twice}\\\\[5pt]\n",

    "\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} &= 0\\tag{four times}\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So it took 4 subtractions of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from 2 to reach 0, therefore $2 \\div \\frac{1}{2} = 4$.\n",
