    "Does this make sense? Recall that when we compute $10\\div 2=5$, what we're working out is the number of groups of 2 we need to make 10. Similarly, the expression $10\\div \\frac13$ is asking how many $\\frac{1}{3}$ pieces can fit into 10 pieces. Since it takes 3 $\\frac{1}{3}$s to make one and 10 ones to make 10, we need $3\\times 10 = 30$ pieces of size $\\frac{1}{3}$ to make 10, therefore $10 \\div \\frac{1}{3} = 10 \\times 3 = 30$.\n",

    "### But why does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that division is the opposite of multiplication: dividing by a number \"undoes\" multiplication by that same number. This has a special name, division is the *inverse operation* of multiplication. Here, we are interested in undoing multiplication by fractions. Let's start with an integer example. Consider the multiplication of 10 by 4: $10 \\times 4 = 40$. To undo the multiplication by 4, we divide by 4: $40 \\div 4 = 10$ and we get back to the original number! Same goes for fractions: consider the product $20 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 10$. Dividing by $\\frac12$ should undo the multiplication. Our rule for division says that to divide by $\\frac{1}{2}$, we multiply by $\\frac21 = 2$: $10 \\div \\frac{1}{2} = 10\\times 2 = 20$. Once again, we get back to the original number!\n",
    "\n",
    "If dividing by 4 is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{1}{4}$, then it's true that dividing by $\\frac{1}{4}$ is equivalent to multiplying by 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if you flip the first number instead of the second? Try it with an example we've already solved. Does it change the answer or does the order not matter like multiplication?\n",
    "\n",
    "### But isn't division supposed to make the number smaller?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is, \"Yes, but only if the number we're dividing by is bigger than 1.\" Try thinking of division as repeated subtraction: $2 \\div \\frac{1}{2}$ is asking how many times can we subtract $\\frac{1}{2}$ from 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hskip-60pt \\begin{align*}\n",

    "Let's review what we've learned in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike addition, multiplying fractions *does not* need common denominators. **DM** – **D**ivision/**M**ultiplication = Denominator **D**oesn’t **M**atter \n",
    "- To multiply to fractions, multiply the numerators, then the denominators, and then reduce if necessary.\n",
    "- It is often easier if you cancel common factors before multiplying the fractions.\n",
    "- Division is the inverse of multiplication. Remember the Golden Rule: division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal! (flipping the numerator and denominator) **KFC** - **K**eep, **F**lip, **C**hange\n",
    "- Multiplication and division involving mixed numbers is easier if you first convert any mixed numbers to improper fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the time to master your fraction multiplication and division. It may not seem like it now, but this is a much needed skill that you'll rely on for many years to come. Many careers even use fractions on a daily basis, like chefs or construction workers. As always in math, the more you practice, the easier it gets!\n"
