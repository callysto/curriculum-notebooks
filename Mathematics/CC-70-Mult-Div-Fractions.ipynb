    "This is a notebook on multiplication and division by fractions. In this notebook, our primary focus will be on the procedural mechanics of these operations, but we'll also stop along the way to address a few conceptual problems. For example, the intuition we've developed from integer arithmetic tells us that multiplication should make a number bigger, and division should make it smaller. But this depends on the number we're multiplying/dividing by! (In particular, it depends on whether that number is greater or less than 1. Remember that fractions allow us to create numbers between 0 and 1 -- see (eventual link to CC-62 notebook?).)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you gain a conceptual understanding of the multiplication and division operations for fractions while developing mechanical proficiency in performing these operations. (But beware that one notebook is not enough! You will need plenty of practice before you master this topic.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find it helpful to review the visual and conceptual foundations of fraction multiplication before proceeding. If you have not already done so, take a few minutes to look at (eventual link to CC-83 notebook?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that (unlike addition) to multiply two fractions, we do **not** need them to have common denominators. The basic rule for fraction multiplication is as follows: multiply the corresponding numerators, do the same for the denominators, and then reduce, if necessary. (*Exception to the rule:* as we'll see below, it's usually easier to reduce -- that is, cancel common factors -- *before* you multiply.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying fractions is taking a small piece from an already small piece, for example we have half a bar of chocolate and want to eat half of what we have, but we want to know how much of the whole chocolate bar we are going to be eating. This word problem describes $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$ and we'll learn methods on how to solve this.\n",

Since it takes 3 $\\frac{1}{3}$s to make one and 10 ones to make 10, we need $3\\times 10 = 30$ pieces of size $\\frac{1}{3}$ to make 10, therefore $10 \\div \\frac{1}{3} = 10 \\times 3 = 30$.\n",

To undo the multiplication by 4, we divide by 4: $40 \\div 4 = 10$ and we get back to the original number! Same goes for fractions: consider the product $20 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 10$. Dividing by $\\frac12$ should undo the multiplication. Our rule for division says that to divide by $\\frac{1}{2}$, we multiply by $\\frac21 = 2$: $10 \\div \\frac{1}{2} = 10\\times 2 = 20$.

    "- Unlike addition, multiplication of fractions does *not* require common denominators. (As a result, many people find multiplication easier than addition when it comes to fractions!)\n",
    "- To multiply to fractions, simlply multiply the corresponding numerators and denominators, and then reduce if necessary.\n",
    "- The arithmetic is often simpler if you cancel common factors prior to multiplication.\n",
    "- Division is easily converted into multiplication. Remember the Golden Rule: division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal!\n",
    "- Multiplication and division involving mixed numbers is most easily performed by first converting any mixed numbers to improper fractions.\n",
