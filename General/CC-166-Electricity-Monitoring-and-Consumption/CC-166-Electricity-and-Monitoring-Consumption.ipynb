    "# Electricity and Monitoring Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be discussing what electricity is, how it is used and how it is monitored. We will also be discussing what circuit diagrams are and how they relate to electricity in your homes."

    "### What is Electricity?\n",
    "\n",
    "In simplest terms electricity is the presence or flow of electrons. If you don't remember what electrons are from your other science courses they are found in atoms. Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/atom.png\" alt=\"\" width=500 align=middle>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find electrons, protons and neutrons in an atom. Negatively charged electrons orbit around the nucleus of the atom which is made up of positively charged protons and neutrons with no charge. Electrons are attracted to the protons in the nucleus. Electrons are much lighter than the nucleus and can be transferred from one atom to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static and Current Electricity\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of electricity will be discussed, static and current electricity. **Static Electricity** is the build up of electrons on an object. A static charge can be formed when the electrons on one object move to another. An example of this would be sliding down a slide and your hair standing on end. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/staticCharge.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=500 align=middle>\n",
    "\n",
    "This results from electrons being transferred from you to the slide leaving you with a net positive charge. You are left with positive charge at the ends of your hair causing them to be repelled from each other and making them stand up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other type of electricity is current electricity. **Current Electricity** is the flow of electrons or electrical energy from one atom to another and in general terms from one place to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/electricCurrentAnimation.gif\" alt=\"\" width=500 align=middle>\n",
    "\n",
    "Current electricity is normally called **Electric Current**. An example of an electric current would be charging your cell phone. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/electricCurrent.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=500 align=middle>\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrons flow from your cell phone charger through the charging cord and into your cell phone creating an electric current. In this notebook we will be focusing on current electricity or electric current and how it is monitored and used throughout our homes. In the rest of the notebook electrical current will generally be referred to as just electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electricity Units\n",
    "Before we move on to the rest of the notebook we need to cover the units that are used when measuring the amount of electricity being used. As electrical current travels through a device the electrons lose energy which can be used to do useful things like produce heat or do work like turning motors. We are often interested how fast this energy is being used, that is **Power**. The unit used to measure the power or the rate of electricity being used is **Watts (W)**. A Watt is one Joule of energy transferred per second.  The power used by a device when it is on is given in Watts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another unit of energy that is used is the **Watt-hour**. A **Watt-hour (Wh)** describes the total amount of electricity (energy) used over the course of an hour. It is a combination of how fast electrical power is being used. To get a better understanding of a Watt-hour let's convert it to Joules of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A Watt measures the amount of Joules per second and can be written as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $\\large 1 \\hspace{1mm} \\text{Watt} = 1 \\hspace{1mm} \\text{W} = 1\\hspace{1mm}\\frac{\\text{Joule}}{\\text{second}} = 1\\hspace{1mm}\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{s}}$ \n",
    ">\n",
    "> In an hour there are 60 minutes and 60 seconds in each minute. The total number of seconds in an hour would be 60x60 = 3600 seconds\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $\\large 1 \\hspace{1mm} \\text{hour} = 3600 \\hspace{1mm} \\text{seconds} = 3600 \\hspace{1mm}\\text{s}$\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Thus in 1 Watt-hour we have 1 J being used every second over the course of an hour. If a Joule is used every second of the hour and there are 3600 seconds in the hour then 1 Watt-hour is equivalent to 3600 Joules.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $\\large 1 \\hspace{1mm} \\text{Wh} = 1\\hspace{1mm}\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{s}} \\times 3600 \\hspace{1mm}\\text{s} = 3600 \\hspace{1mm}\\text{J}$ \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Compared to the Joule, a Watt-hour is a more convenient unit to measure the amount of energy consumed by an item over the course of some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kilo, Mega and Giga \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other terms you may see in this notebook are **kilowatts (kW)**, **megawatts (MW)** and **gigawatts (GW)**. A kilowatt is 1000 watts, a megawatt is 1 million watts and a gigawatt is 1 billion watts. You will also see the term **kilowatt-hours (kWh)** which is 1000 Watt-hours. It can also be thought of as using electricity for 1 hour at a rate of 1000 watts. \n",

    "## Electricity Use\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common knowledge that electricity is used to power our homes, vehicles and the various electronic devices we use on a daily basis. So how much electrical power does it actually take to charge your smart phone, use your oven or run a refrigerator? In this section we will answer those questions and take a look at the electricity use of various electronic devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever looked at the back of a washing machine, dryer or other electrical appliances you may have noticed a label giving a number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year. This label is known as an efficiency label giving energy-related information about the product. In Canada this label is known as the EnerGuide label. Examples of this label are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",

    "</tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four key pieces of information that the EnerGuide label tells us:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It tells us the annual energy consumption of the appliance in kilowatt-hours. \n",
    "2. On the label it has the annual energy consumption for the most efficienct and least efficient models and were the appliance falls in between them. \n",
    "3. The energy consumption indicator positions the appliance model based on a comparison of other models in the same class. \n",
    "4. The label also has the type and capacity of models that make up the appliance class as well as the model number. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are most interested in the annual energy consumption since it tells us the average amount of electricity the appliance uses over the course of a year. It should be noted that not all electrical appliances  have an EnerGuide label as it is not manadatory for all electrical appliances."

    "## Circuit Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have covered what electricity is, the various electrical devices and how it is monitored let's take a look at **circuit diagrams**. A circuit diagram is a graphical representation of an **electrical circuit**. An electrical circuit  is a network of electrical devices connected together. All of the electronic devices in your home make up a very complicated electrical circuit that can be represented with a circuit diagram. We are just starting to learn about circuit diagrams so we will be using simple examples such a light bulb connected to a battery that you can see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/circuit1.png\" alt=\"\" width=500 align=middle>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover six different circuit components that can make up a circuit, namely switches, power sources, resistors, lights, motors and wires. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **switch** can either be open or closed. If it is open the electricity can't flow through the swtich. If it is closed the electricity can flow through the switch. A switch can be thought of as a light switch. If the light switch is on the electricity is flowing and if it is off the electricity is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A **power source** is any type of device that provides power/electricity. The simple example of a power source we will use is a battery that provides electricity to electrical devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A **resistor** is a component that resists the flow of electricity when it flows through it. The resistor limits the flow of electricity in the circuit. Electrical energy will be lost as heat when electricity flows through a resistor. An example of needing to use a resistor would be when you have two devices in a circuit and one of the devices can only handle so much electricity. You would then need a resistor to limit the flow of electricity to the device. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. A **light** will be some device that produces light. Electrical energy will be lost to this radiant energy as electricity powers the light. The simple example we will use is a light bulb/lamp that generates light.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A **motor** is a device that is used to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. Motors are used in a variety of electrical devices ranging from a vehicle motor to a motor in a refrigerator. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. A **wire** is a component that is conductive and allows electricity to flow through it. Wires are used to connect the other various components together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue on we need to cover some units that are commonly used for the components that make up a circuit. We have already covered **Watts** and **Joules**, we will also cover **Volts**, **Amperes**, **Ohms** and **Coulombs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **coulomb (C)** is defined as a of charge. One coulomb is the amount of charge contained in $6.24 \\times 10^{18}$ electrons or 6.24 quintillion electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **ampere (A)** is a unit used to measure electrical current (electricity). It is a measurement of the number of electrons flowing through a circuit. It is defined as one Coulomb of charge passing a certain point in a circuit in one second.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **volt (V)** is a unit of electric potential or electromotive force that causes the electrons to flow. A volt can be defined as the potential difference between two points. In terms of **Joules** and **Coulombs** one volt will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through the two points. The power sources in the circuit will have units of volts as they create the flow of electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **ohm ($\\Omega$)** is a unit of electrical resistance that can be defined as one volt per ampere ($\\Omega = V/A)$ . The higher the resistance in ohms the lower the flow of electricity. As you can guess the resistors have units of ohms since they resist the flow of electricity. Each device in a circuit will also have some resistance to them that slows the flow of the electrons. For example the resistance in a lamp causes it to lose heat energy in addition to the energy emitted as light."
