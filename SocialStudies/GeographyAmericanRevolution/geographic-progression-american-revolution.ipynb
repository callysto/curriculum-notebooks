The North Pole is listed at 90 degrees, and the South Pole is listed at -90 degrees. The more \"degrees latitude\" a location is, the further away it is from the equator. For example, 50 degrees latitude is further from the equator than 20 degrees latitude is. Depending on if a location is above or below the equator, they are listed as \"degrees North\" or \"degrees South\", and are given a matching positive (+) or negative (-) symbol. \n",

Conversely, parallels located north to the Equator are blue, and this part of the Earth is called the Northern Hemisphere.\n"

    "In contrast to latitude, longitude lines Lines are vertical systems of measurement that encircle the globe from north to south. Longitude lines converge at poles and are widest at the equator. Longitude lines can also be called \"meridian lines\". Longitude shows how far a location is east or west of a universal vertical line, called the Prime Meridian. The Prime Meridian line runs through the British Royal Observatory in Greenwich England, from the North Pole to the South Pole. As the vertical starting point for longitude, the Prime Meridian is defined as 0 degrees longitude. Interestingly, for many years, each country had its own prime meridian. In 1884, a group of scientists, navigators, and business owners made Greenwich, England, the official worldwide Prime Meridian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longitude lines span 180 degrees both east and west of the Prime Meridian. Longitude lines that are **east** of the prime meridian are positive (+), and lines that are **west** of the Prime Meridian are negative (-). The longitude line that is exactly 180 degrees east and west of the Prime Meridian is known as the International Date Line (it is directly opposite to the Prime Meridian). \n",
    "\n",
    "Lines of longitude at every ten degrees are shown on the globe below, try rotating it and hover your mouse over different meridians. If you click on the any meridian listed on the right it will disappear/reappear on the map. On this map, the blue meridians located east of the Prime Meridian are part of the Eastern Hemisphere. The organge meridians located west to the Prime Meridian are part of the Western Hemisphere."
