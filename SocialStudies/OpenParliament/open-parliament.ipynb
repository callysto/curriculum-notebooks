    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Canadian government provides transcripts of debates in the House of Commons, called the [Hansard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansard). In this notebook we imported the Hansard data from 2020 and identified the frequencies of some [parts of speech](https://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/pos) using [natural language processing]([spaCy](https://spacy.io)). We also found which parties spoke the most relative to their seats alongside how often certain members of Parliament spoke. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also used the Hansard to find out which topics each party prioritized and experimented if you were able to identify parties based on the top 10 topics they spoke about. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, using [openparliament.ca](https:https://openparliament.ca/), we identified trends of bill voting, specifically how certain members/parties of Parliament voted on certain bills alongside trends on which bills passed or failed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you can try extension activities such as investigating predictions on which bills pass or fail in Parliament, identifying the most common [named entities](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-named-entity-recognition-ner-using-spacy), or creating [word clouds](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks/blob/master/EnglishLanguageArts/WordClouds/word-clouds.ipynb)"
