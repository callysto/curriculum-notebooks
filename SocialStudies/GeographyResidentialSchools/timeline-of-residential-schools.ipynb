In December 2015 TRC came up with the final report which gave in detail the history of residential schools, their devastating legacy, and the abuse left by these residential schools. The intention of this notebook is to raise awareness about residential schools and why it is important to be supportive and inclusive of different groups of people, languages, and cultures."

    "The Canadian government in the 19th century decided that it was responsible for providing education and care for the aboriginal people of the country in order to assimilate them into the Canadian society. The government believed that the only way to achieve this is by separating the students from their families and denying access to their own culture, language, and traditions. The government also believed that the best chance of success for these students was to learn English and to adopt Christianity and Canadian customs. This way the students will pass on the newly adopted lifestyle, language and culture to their children which would completely abolish the native traditions in a few generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to put these into action, the Canadian government developed a policy called \"aggressive assimilation\" to be taught at the government-funded educational institutions which were church-run and provided the Indigenous children with rudimentary training in the trades and agriculture. The government believed that the children were easier to mold than adults and the concept of boarding school with compulsory attendance where children were separated from their families and communities was the best way to prepare them for life in the mainstream society.\n",
