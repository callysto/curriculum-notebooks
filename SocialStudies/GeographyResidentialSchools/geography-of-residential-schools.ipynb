    "The Canadian government in the 19th century decided that it was responsible for providing education and care for the aboriginal people of the country in order to assimilate them into the Canadian society. The government believed that the only way to achieve this is by separating the students from their families and denying access to their own culture, language, and traditions. The government also believed that the best chance of success for these students was to learn English and to adopt Christianity and Canadian customs. This way the students will pass on the newly adopted lifestyle, language and culture to their children which would completely abolish the native traditions in a few generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to put these into action, the Canadian government developed a policy called \"aggressive assimilation\" to be taught at the government-funded educational institutions which were church-run and provided the Indigenous children with rudimentary training in the trades and agriculture. The government believed that the children were easier to mold than adults and the concept of boarding school with compulsory attendance where children were separated from their families and communities was the best way to prepare them for life in the mainstream society."

    "In contrast to latitude, longitude lines Lines are vertical systems of measurement that encircle the globe from north to south. Longitude lines converge at poles and are widest at the equator. Longitude lines can also be called \"meridian lines\". Longitude shows how far a location is east or west of a universal vertical line, called the Prime Meridian. The Prime Meridian line runs through the British Royal Observatory in Greenwich England, from the North Pole to the South Pole. As the vertical starting point for longitude, the Prime Meridian is defined as 0 degrees longitude. Interestingly, for many years, each country had its own prime meridian. In 1884, a group of scientists, navigators, and business owners made Greenwich, England, the official worldwide Prime Meridian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longitude lines span 180 degrees both east and west of the Prime Meridian. Longitude lines that are **east** of the prime meridian are positive (+), and lines that are **west** of the Prime Meridian are negative (-). The longitude line that is exactly 180 degrees east and west of the Prime Meridian is known as the International Date Line (it is directly opposite to the Prime Meridian). \n",
    "\n",
    "Lines of longitude at every ten degrees are shown on the globe below, try rotating it and hover your mouse over different meridians. If you click on any meridian listed on the right it will disappear/reappear on the map. On this map, the blue meridians located east of the Prime Meridian are part of the Eastern Hemisphere. The orange meridians located west to the Prime Meridian are part of the Western Hemisphere."
