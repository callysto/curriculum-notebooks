    "The [Human Development Index](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) (HDI) stands as a pivotal tool designed by the United Nations to provide a comprehensive assessment of a nation's development. The emphasis behind the HDI is the fundamental principle that the well-being and capabilities of individuals should serve as the primary indicators of a country's progress, rather than relying solely on economic growth. Comprised of various key dimensions, the HDI aims to offer a holistic perspective on human development by evaluating the average progress on three fundamental aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A Long and Healthy Life**: This dimension encompasses the evaluation of life expectancy, reflecting the overall health and well-being of the population within a nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Knowledge**: This dimension takes into account factors such as educational attainment and the overall accessibility to education, indicating the level of intellectual development within a society.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **A Decent Standard of Living**: The HDI also considers the standard of living within a country, taking into account various socioeconomic factors that contribute to the quality of life, such as income, employment opportunities, and access to basic amenities.\n",

    "A more thorough analysis can be found using the UN's [technical notes](https://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2021-22_HDR/hdr2021-22_technical_notes.pdf) diagram on how they developed their HDI scoring model: \n",

We were able to uncover *trends* and *patterns* in HDI scores across different time periods and visualized these trends. \n",

We extended our usage of our machine-learning model by predicting the HDI scores of countries that could not be scored using the formula the United Nations developed. \n",
