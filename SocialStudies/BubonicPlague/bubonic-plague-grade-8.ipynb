Instead, unaware of the dramatic situation that was unfolding, traders from Italian cities maintained very active relationships with the rest of Europe through marine or land trading routes. This resulted in the disease spreading very fast to Southern Europe within six months, and from there turning into a European-wide pandemic within three years.\n", "\n", "The dynamic map below illustrates this.\n", "\n", "Given there was no precise record of population numbers at this time, it is difficult to have a precise estimation of the number of death. But by analyzing local reports of casualties, historians have arrived to the conclusion that roughly half of the European population at this time died from the bubonic plague.
