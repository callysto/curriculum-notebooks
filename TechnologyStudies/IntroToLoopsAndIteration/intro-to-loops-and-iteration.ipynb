If that condition still holds, then we will continue to print and decrement. If `n = 0` then the condition is no longer `True`, so the computer will not enter the `while` loop."

    "`for` loops differ from `while` loops in that `for` loops will iterate a fixed number of times, whereas a `while` loop will continue until the condition is no longer satisfied.
