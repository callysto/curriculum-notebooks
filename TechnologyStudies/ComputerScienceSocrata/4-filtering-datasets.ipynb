    "# 4. Filtering Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We have experimented with visualizing open source data in a browser. However, lets broaden our perspective and consider how designing queries is an important part of designing any data-drive applications, including many of those that run on phones and tablets. For example, consider a mobile app that plots schools within walking distance to the user on a map. We want to plot only a small subset of all schools in Calgary. How should this application filter the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general approaches, named after the location where the data actually gets filtered: the server (i.e. where the data is stored) or the client (where the data is used). These may be on same device, or they may be separated. They are also very likely running on different technologies. Filtering on either side has its pros and cons:"

    "### Server-side filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already seen this type of filter through the use of tht WHERE clause in SODA. This approach reduces the amount of data that you receive from wherever that data is stored. The data is likely being sent across a network (in the case of cloud-based data) or from a different application (in the case of a more traditional database system). If the speed of the data transmission is limited (e.g. slow internet) or if the data transmission is costly (e.g. the user's data plan is limited), then you may very well wish to use a server-side filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, below is our familiar SODA query for obtaining all schools within Calgary. I've created a WHERE clause that finds all schools within a 'square' around the 'current' location, which we will assume to be William Aberhart High School (51.07866950960592°, -114.11533747920511°). To keep things simple, I will make my square 2 $\\times$ 0.01 degree latitude by 2 $\\times$ 0.01 degree longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "if you are curious, according to [this calculator](http://www.csgnetwork.com/degreelenllavcalc.html), 0.01 degree latitude equals about 1.112 km, and one minute longitude at Calgary's latitude equals about 0.702 kilometres, so this would be a box about 2.2 by 1.4 km"

    "\n",
    "If your application will show multiple views of the data set within a short time, it makes sense to download it once in its entirety. Requerying for the data for each view would obviously be inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, loading the data in its entirity will cost more bandwith, and may take time up front. Also, your data will at some point go stale; hence the 'within a short time' qualifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why not just query for little chunks of data only when needed? Well, you probably have already noticed that executing a query takes some time. The query has to pass from your local device to a remote server, the server has to retrieve the data and format it, and the the server has to pass it back across a network. The lag in time between query and response is known as *latency*. Latency may make your application appear to freeze. This may be frustrating to your user. Never mind what your user may experience if they lose their network connection completely. \n",
    "\n",
    "The time gaps in between the various steps may be fractions of seconds, but that is an eternity compared to how fast your local device can process locally stored data. Thus, loading your data up front *may* be a good design decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the client-side approach would probably be best. The dataset is relatively small, so data usage is reasonable, unless the data plan really is restrive. Also, the data is highly static, as not many schools will get added in the next month, and none will change location. Thus, it would be good design to download the dataset, and perhaps even store it locally in a csv file. You can then move all around the city, and the map can be updated very quickly and without extra data transmission. Of course, your app will still want to update the dataset once in a while, and may need to load the Edmonton data if we change cities!\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate example could be an app that checks if any of your friends are within walking distance. Perhaps this app has a few million users, and their locations are being stored on a server somewhere in Silicon Valley. You would not want to download the entire dataset, as 99.99% of it would be useless to you. Furthermore, the data is highly dynamic, and if you don't update continuously, you will have a useless app. In this example, the server-side approach would undoubtedly be best."

    "- To be quite honest, there will also be times where it is just easier to do your filtering (and aggregation) on the client side, instead of breaking your brain in writing the perfect SQL statement!\n",
