    "The input/process/output (IPO) approach is widely used to solve a computing problem. We will also use this approach to solve the sequential algorithm computing problem using the python programming. This IPO approach will also help us to learn the introductory Python knowledge. Let's see the following points and it will give you the clear idea:\n",

    "1. **Input** is pre-existing data of the algorithm, which has been provided by an external system. In this notebook, pre-existing data will be variable and external system will be you or reader. \n",

    "2. **Process** is the most important in this IPO approach. In another way, we can say that it is the heart of the algorithm.

Here, logical operation will be arithmetic operations based on the output of the algorithm. \n",

    "***Write an algorithm or program that will take numbers from you/user, and show the average of these three number.***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",

    "* The goal of this algorithm is to compute the average of three numbers. So, we have to take these three numbers, which will act as **input** of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, we have to find the process part of the algorithm. To find that we have to think how you will get the average from these three numbers. We have to perform following arithmetic operation to get the output, which will act as **process** part of the algorithm. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Finally, we will get the average of these three numbers at the **output** stage from the process part.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is an introductory level of python notebook. First, we introduced some fundamental knowledge of python programming as printing a statement using `print` command, familiar with various forms (i.e. string, integer, float) of variables, and how to a take various forms of variables as input from the user using `input` function. Then we familiarized with the sequential algorithm and the IPO approach to solve the algorithm. Each part of IPO approach was also discussed. Finally, we introduced two simple and real-life examples of the sequential algorithm using the IPO approach and solved them using the introductory knowledge of python programming that we learned earlier in this notebook. In those examples, we showed the technique to select the input and process unit, test cases to check the Python program, error from program, and revised program to overcome the error. We also introduced three exercises for practice purpose. The Python programs were also provided for the first two exercises for learning purposes. Various test cases are provided for each exercise to test the output. This notebook will help the user learning the introductory level python programming skill by solving sequential algorithms using the IPO approach."
