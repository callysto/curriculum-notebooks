    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is a process that instructs the computer to perform a task. Let's think you have a task to write 1 to 1000. It will take a lot of time if you want to write this using pen and paper. But you can easily do it by writing a few lines of a program. Programming will make your life simple in complex work. There are so many programming languages have been demonstrated so far. Python is one of them, which is widely used and the most popular one. In fact, Python becomes the No. 1 programming language in 2017 based on [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages), and is used to build many popular websites like Youtube and Instagram. In this notebook, we will learn this python language to solve simple real-life sequential algorithm-based problems using the input-process-output (IPO) approach. The sequential algorithm performs it's each part of task sequentially, which is easy to implement in Python programming language. Each part of IPO approach will help us to learn the introductory Python programming knowledge. Thus, this notebook will give the user introductory level Python programming knowledge."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introductory level of python notebook. First, we introduced some fundamental knowledge of python programming as printing a statement using `print` command, familiar with various forms (i.e. string, integer, float) of variables, and how to a take various forms of variables as input from the user using `input` function. Then we familiarized with the sequential algorithm and the IPO approach to solve the algorithm. Each part of IPO approach was also discussed. Finally, we introduced two simple and real-life examples of the sequential algorithm using the IPO approach and solved them using the introductory knowledge of python programming that we learned earlier in this notebook. In those examples, we showed the technique to select the input and process unit, test cases to check the Python program, error from program, and revised program to overcome the error. We also introduced three exercises for practice purpose. The Python programs were also provided for the first two exercises for learning purposes. Various test cases are provided for each exercise to test the output. This notebook will help the user learning the introductory level python programming skill by solving sequential algorithms using the IPO approach."
