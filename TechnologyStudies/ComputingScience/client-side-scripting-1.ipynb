    "Students are introduced to Internet computing through the use of one or more Web-specific markup languages. As part of this process, students learn how the Web uses markup languages to provide a client-side approach to display static information. Students also learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and documents that use a markup language.\n",
