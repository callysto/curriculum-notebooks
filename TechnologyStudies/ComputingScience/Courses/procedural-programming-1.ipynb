    "Students develop their understanding of the procedural programming paradigm. They move from a structured programming approach in which modules were handled through the use of program blocks to a more formal modular programming approach in which they are handled through subprograms. In the process, students also learn to use a number of new design approaches made possible by the new paradigms. As part of this process, they also learn what types of problems are amenable to modular algorithms and programs.\n",
