    "In computer science, time complexity is a concept used to describe the *amount of time* it takes for an algorithm to run as a **function** of the length of the input. It helps us understand how the algorithm's running time increases with the *size of the input*. Time complexity is usually expressed using **big O notation**, denoted as \"O\", which stands for the \"*order of complexity*\". Essentially, big O notation establishes an upper limit on the growth rate of the running time concerning the input size. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of **O(n)**, it means the algorithm's running time grows *linearly* with the size of the input. If it has a time complexity of **O(n^2)**, the running time grows quadratically with the input size, and so on. Understanding time complexity is essential for evaluating and comparing the efficiency of different algorithms, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
