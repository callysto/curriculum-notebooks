It helps us understand how the algorithm's running time increases with the *size of the input*. Time complexity is usually expressed using **big O notation**, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the running time in terms of the input size.\n",

Understanding time complexity is essential for evaluating and comparing the efficiency of different algorithms, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",

    "In the average case, the element being searched is equally likely to be present at any position in the list. Therefore, on average, the algorithm needs to search through half of the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n/2), where *n* is the length of the input list. However, in algorithmic analysis, this simplifies to O(n).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Binary Search** is an efficient searching algorithm specifically designed for sorted lists. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half by using two pointers (generally denoted as left and right). By comparing the *middle* element of the sorted list with the target value, it determines whether the target value is present in the *lower* or *upper* half of the interval. This process continues until the value is found, or the interval is empty.\n",

    "Using binary search also offers a significant improvement in search efficiency, with a time complexity of **O(log n)** in the *worst case*, where **n** is the *number of elements in the list*. This logarithmic time complexity makes it highly efficient, especially for large datasets, compared to linear search algorithms. Let's showcase a visualization of how binary search works."
