It helps us understand how the algorithm's running time increases with the *size of the input*. Time complexity is usually expressed using **big O notation**, denoted as \"O\", which stands for the \"*order of complexity*\". Essentially, big O notation establishes an upper limit on the growth rate of the running time concerning the input size. \n",

Understanding time complexity is essential for evaluating and comparing the efficiency of different algorithms, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",

It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half by using two pointers (generally denoted as left and right). By comparing the *middle* element of the sorted list with the target value, it determines whether the target value is present in the *lower* or *upper* half of the interval. This process continues until the value is found, or the interval is empty.\n",

    "\n",
    "Merge-sort is an efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that operates on the principle of breaking down the input list into smaller sub-lists, sorting them individually, and then merging them to produce a sorted output. It is known for its stability and consistent **O(n log n)** time complexity for all cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Divide:** The unsorted list is divided into two halves until each sub-list contains only one element.\n",
    "2. **Conquer:** The sub-lists are then merged back together in a sorted manner.\n",
    "3. **Combine:** During the merging process, the algorithm compares the elements of the two sub-lists and arranges them in the correct order."

Merge sort will still divide the list into sub-lists and perform the merge operation, but there will be no rearrangement of your elements during the merging process. This results in a time complexity of O(n log n), where **n** is the number of elements in the input list and **log n** represents the number of times the input size needs to be divided by 2 to reach 1. \n",

    "The worst-case scenario is a bit more tricky to understand for merge-sort. Suppose we have a list that contains the elements [0,2,4,6,1,3,5,7]. When we split the list into two sublists, we get [0,2,4,6] and [1,3,5,7], Continuing to break this sub-list, you start to see a pattern where on every element, we have to compare it at least once, resulting in the worst-case scenario. The time complexity, however, remains the same at O(n log n) More information about the worst-case scenario can be found [here](https://iq.opengenus.org/worse-case-of-merge-sort/)."
