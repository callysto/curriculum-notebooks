    "In computer science, time complexity is a concept used to describe the *amount of time* it takes for an algorithm to run as a **function** of the length of the input. It helps us understand how the algorithm's running time increases with the *size of the input*. Time complexity is usually expressed using **big O notation**, denoted as \"O\", which stands for the \"*order of complexity*\". Essentially, big O notation establishes an upper limit on the growth rate of the running time concerning the input size. \n",

Understanding time complexity is essential for evaluating and comparing the efficiency of different algorithms, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",

    "**Binary Search** is an efficient searching algorithm specifically designed for sorted lists. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half by using two pointers (generally denoted as left and right). By comparing the *middle* element of the sorted list with the target value, it determines whether the target value is present in the *lower* or *upper* half of the interval. This process continues until the value is found, or the interval is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using binary search also offers a significant improvement in search efficiency, with a time complexity of **O(log n)** in the *worst case*, where **n** is the *number of elements in the list*. This logarithmic time complexity makes it highly efficient, especially for large datasets, compared to linear search algorithms. Let's showcase a visualization of how binary search works.\n",

    "**Best Case Time-Complexity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the best case scenario, the list is already sorted. Merge sort will still divide the list into sub-lists and perform the merge operation, but there will be no rearrangement of your elements during the merging process. This results in a time complexity of `O(n log n)`, where **log n** represents the number of times the input size needs to be divided by 2 to reach 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst Case Time-Complexity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The worst-case scenario is a bit more tricky to understand for merge-sort. Suppose we have a list that contains the elements [0,2,4,6,1,3,5,7]. When we split the list into two sublists, we get [0,2,4,6] and [1,3,5,7], Continuing to break this sub-list, you start to see a pattern where on every element, we have to compare it at least once, resulting in the worst-case scenario. The time complexity, however, remains the same at O(n log n) More information about the worst-case scenario can be found [here](https://iq.opengenus.org/worse-case-of-merge-sort/)."
