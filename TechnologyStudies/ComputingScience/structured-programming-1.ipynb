    "    2. analyze a variety of simple algorithms and describe the task or tasks the algorithms are attempting to carry out\n",
    "    3. analyze problems and determine if they can be solved using algorithms that employ an input/processing/output (IPO) approach\n",
    "    4. decompose the problem into its input, processing and output components, and identify what data is already available to the program and what must be inputted\n",
    "    5. sequence components appropriately so that processing occurs only when all required data is available and output occurs only after appropriate processing has occurred\n",
