    "## Python Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Python Class** is a structure that can group together relevant variables and functions. The variables and functions in this structure are designed to be used only in the context of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give more accurate terminology, the functions defined inside a class are called **methods** and the variables are called **attributes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sound familiar? We have already seen Python structures with methods, such as lists, dictionaries and strings. (See introduction to data structures in Python). If we wanted to access these methods, we used the dot operator. This is also true for Python classes. To use the actual functions, or methods, inside a Python class, we use the dot operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of fact, classes make up the Python standard library, such as the string class, but are also a central programming technique used in Python, as well as C and C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we cannot actually do anything with our class just by defining it and adding attributes and methods. If we want to do some work, we have to define an **instance** of our class. To see what we mean, suppose we define a class called Person. This class has attributes that we would associate with a person, such as height, age, weight, gender, etc. The methods in the person class would be actions a person would do, such as Work(), DoHomework(), Eat(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot say, Person.Work(), as Person is a definition and not an instance. We would have to declare an instance of that class. Say Person Sally. Now, Sally is an instance of the Person class, and Sally can have **unique values**. If we were to create another instance of Person, such as Person Frank, the values of Frank and Sally's attributes would be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we declared Sally and Frank just as normal variables of type Person. Python classes allow you to create your own data types, with specified attributes and methods. This allows for a larger range of problem solving abilities, as well as more robust data handling and orginization."

    "### Remark:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many languages that support classes such as C, C++ and Java. A major difference between Python classes and classes in C++ and Java is in the way data inside a class is handled and accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++ and Java, we are allowed to create what are know as private and public variables. Private variables are variables which cannot be accessed from outside the class. In order to access them, we need to create methods inside the class, which allows a user to modfiy the variables. These methods are explored later on in this notebook. We use private variables when there is sensitive data inside a class. We do not want a user to directly access the data, as it would threaten the integrity of the program or privacy of another user. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a public attribute is a attribute that can be accessed from outside the class. In general, all attributes in a Python class or instance are public -- but it can be a good practice to treat them like they're not."

    "## A word on Object Oriented Programming and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So what exacly is Object Oriented Programming (Or OOP for short)? OOP is a programming method in which the primary building blocks used to create the program are objects, and the objects interact with each other through methods. Inside these objects are variables and functions that are related to each other in some way. \n",
    "\n",
    "OOP allows for better code organization, as we can group related functions and variables in one spot under one name.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP also allows for what is called **data abstraction**. Data abstraction is a way of seperating the way we have written the object, and the way a user interacts with said object.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP allows for whats known as **data encapsulation**. Data encapsulation allows us to hide sensitive information from the user. If the user wants to change that information, they must go through the objects methods to do so, instead of modifiying the value directly. Doing this will ensure that our data does not get unwanted values which cause the object to break in some way. A more extreme version of data encapsulation is **data hiding**. Data hiding occurs when the user can neither see nor access certain information through the objects methods. You would do something like this if the information is very sensitive or important for the program to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when we are working with strings, we have access to string functions and methods. However, as a user of these methods and functions, we don't really need to know how these methods or functions work to use them. This is an example of data abstraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to access the constants in a string class, such as the ascii string, which is defined to be \"abcdefghi...xyz\", we would have to explicitly state that we want to use it. We would have to say: string.ascii_lowercase. This is an example of data encapsulation. If we want to use a piece of information, we have to use the object to obtain it.\n",
