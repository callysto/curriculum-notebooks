    "When light shines onto the surface of an object, some of the light is reflected, while the rest is either absorbed or transmitted. We can imagine the light consisting of many narrow beams that travel in straight-line paths called **rays**. The light rays that strike the surface are called the **incident rays**. The light rays that reflect off the surface are called the **reflected rays**. This model of light is called the **ray model**, and it can be used to describe many aspects of light, including the reflection and formation of images by plane and spherical mirrors.\n",

The **angle of incidence, $\\theta_{i}$,** is the angle between the incident ray and the normal. Likewise, the **angle of reflection, $\\theta_{r}$,** is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal. The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the reflecting surface all lie within the same plane. This is shown in the figure above. Notice that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. This is known as the **law of reflection**, and it can be expressed by the following equation:\n",

    "A **plane mirror** is simply a mirror made from a flat (or planar) surface. These types of mirrors are commonly found in bedroom or bathroom fixtures. When an object is reflected in a plane mirror, the image of the object appears to be located behind the mirror. This is because our brains interpret the reflected light rays entering our eyes as having traveled in straight-line paths. The light rays entering our eyes simply do not contain enough information for our brains to differentiate between a straight-line path and a path that changed direction due to a reflection.  \n",

Since the light rays do not actually go behind the mirror, they are represented as projections using dashed lines. If a film were placed at the image location behind the mirror, it would not be able to capture the image. As a result, this type of image is called a **virtual image**. \n",

    "## Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to determine the position and characteristics of an image formed by the rays reflected from a spherical mirror is to construct a **ray diagram**. A ray diagram is used to shown the path taken by light rays as they reflect from an object or mirror. This was used to find the image created by a plane mirror in the previous section. When constructing a ray diagram, we need only consider ourselves with finding the location of a single point on the reflected image. To do this, any point on the object may be chosen, but for consistency, we will choose the topmost point for the diagrams shown below. Any rays may be chosen, but there are three particular rays that are easy to draw:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ray 1:** This ray is drawn parallel to the principle axis from a point on the object to the surface of the mirror. Since the incident ray is parallel to the principle axis, the reflected ray must pass through the focus. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ray 2:** This ray is drawn from a point on the object and through the focus. Since the incident ray passes through the focus, the reflected ray must be parallel to the principle axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ray 3:** This ray is drawn from a point on the object and through the centre of curvature. This ray is therefore perpendicular to the mirror's surface (incident angle = 0). As such, the reflected ray must return along the same path and pass through the centre of curvature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The point at which any two of these three rays converge can be used to find the location and characteristics of the reflected image."
