This gave him the tools to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of military cannons in the 17th century. The reason we study it today is because his method has stood the test of time and continues to be a fundamental foundation to areas like aerodynamics, sports performance, and military design.  \n",

    "For the purposes of understanding the fundamentals, the effects of air resistance will be ignored. While it makes our lives simpler, it is wrong to assume that projectiles only experience the force of gravity - air resistance can play a significant role in many cases. Air resistance is responsible for lower projectile speeds and distances but it is also critical to helping airplanes slow down, keeping race cars grounded at high speeds (which is why they have spoilers), and causing crazy phenomena like the Magnus effect shown below. \n",

    "1. **%matplotlib inline:** This is very specific to the Jupyter notebook we're using. This tells matplotlib (next bullet) to output graphs in the cell directly below the one in which the code is executed. For more information about Jupyter \"magic commands\" feel free to read [this document](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **import matplotlib**: This command tells Python to import the `matplotlib` package. This package contains the python functions that we'll be using for plotting. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **import numpy as np**: This imports the python package `numpy` or \"numerical python\" and assigns the name to it within our code to `np` so we don't have to type out `numpy` every time we need a function. We'll be using this package for mathematical functions like sine and the square root.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **import matplotlib.pyplot as plt**: This imports the graphing subroutines from the `matplotlib` packages and assigns them the name `plt` so we don't have to type as much when we want to produce a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Plotting__  \n",
    "After required modules have been imported into our script, we're ready to get started graphing. First up, we need to define a number of points which to plot. Our computer doesn't understand that the variable $ \\theta $ is fully continuous, so we have to give it a discrete set of points to plot our function with. We can do that in python using numpy as follows (click the next cell and press control and enter at the same time on your keyboard)."

The `print` function is a standard python function that simply displays our variables to the screen as either numbers or characters. In order to plot our functions, we type the following. Note that we've increased the number of points in `theta` to create a smoother plot. Feel free to change the number `100` to something smaller and observe how the plot changes. We also assigned a value to `v_i` and `g` so that the computer can plot the function numerically. Likewise, play around with these numbers and see how your range changes."

    "There's a fair bit going on in that last line of code that should be noted. First, by using `plt.plot` we're calling a function from `matplotlib.pyplot` (that we called `plt`) called `plot`. This function, unsurprisingly, is used to tell Python what to plot. We then pass this function a number of arguments (AKA inputs). The first argument `theta` is the list of numbers we generated earlier. The second argument `2 / g * (v_i**2) * np.sin(np.deg2rad(theta)) * np.cos(np.deg2rad(theta))` is the mathematical function we're going to plot. Here `theta` is the variable we're going to plot, and also the list of points that we generated earlier. The `**` is the Python way of saying \"to the power of\". Because `sin` and `cos` functions take radians as an input and not degrees, we use `np.deg2rad` which is a function that converts degrees to radians. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we're really saying here is \"plot $ \\frac{2}{g}v_i^2 \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)  $ for 100 $\\theta$ values between 0 and 90\".\n",

    "where the `plt.` calls are still calling functions from `matplotlib.pyplot` however this time we're creating x axes labels with `plt.xlabel` and y axes labels with `plt.ylabel`. `plt.margins(0)` removes any unnecessary blank space around the graph and `plt.grid()` adds a nice grid to visually locate points on the graph easier. Finally, `plt.title` adds a title bar to our graph. The dollar signs and \"r\" characters are just there to make the lettering look nice. Play around with the code and see if you can change the title bar, label font sizes, and margins.  <br>\n",

    "Based on the plot above, we see that the maximum range lines up with a launch angle of 45&deg; . Was this your initial guess?  \n",
    "\n",
    "With no air resistance, 45&deg; is the optimal angle because it provides the best compromise between horizontal speed and height. If you shoot it below 45&deg;, you'll get a faster horizontal velocity but the ball will also hit the ground quicker because there's less flight time. If you shoot it above 45&deg;, you'll get more flight time but a slower horizontal velocity. 45&deg; is the sweet spot between extremes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the graphical solution takes the shape of a parabola, this also demonstrates an important symmetry in the launch angles. Launch angles that are equidistant from the maximum of 45&deg; will have the same range. That is, 30&deg; and 60&deg; have the same range, 15&deg; and 75&deg; have the same range, etc. The wonders of physics!"

    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated the basics of projectile motion that can be used to determine flight paths, speeds, and times. Reasoning for why projectile motion is foundational to physics is explained, followed by a breakdown describing the horizontal and vertical components of projectile motion. The two components were brought together in an angled launch example with an interactive graph and the final question utilized Python programming to solve a basic calculus problem. Applying the skills taught in this notebook to your practice examples will give you a strong grasp of projectile motion analysis and enable __you__ to begin designing your own basic launchers!\n",
