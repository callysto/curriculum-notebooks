They tells us qualitatively and quantitatively what happens to an object (with mass) when a force has been acted on the object. Without these laws we wouldn't be able to send people (or Teslas) into space! In this notebook we will focus on the Newton's Second Law after first reviewing his First Law."

This allows us to carefully analyze the motion of an object once it has been impacted by the force. An important aspect of understanding this motion is to be familiar with vectors and their notation, so before we get more in depth with Newton's $2^{\\rm nd}$ Law let's look at what vectors are!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors and Their Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard definiton for a vector says that they represent both the magnitude and direction of some physical quanity. These quantities can include forces, velocity, acceleration and electromagnetic fields, just to name a few. Vectors (we will use an arbitrary variable $v$) are often denoted as $\\vec{v}$ or as $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Both styles are valid choices when typing on a computer but of course by hand it is most acceptable to write vectors with the arrow notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now, what does a vector actually look like? Well when looking at the cartesian coordinate system (Euclidean space) we get the usual coordinate axis that looks something like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/Cartesian_axes.png\" height='500px' width = '500px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Within these coordinates it is then very easy to generate a vector that has both *magnitude* and *direction*. Check it out!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/Vector_2.png\" heigh = '500px' width = '500px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the magnitude of this vector it only takes simple trigonometry (only in cartesian coordinates for 2D space). We define the magnitude as \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lvert\\lvert\\vec{v}\\rvert\\rvert = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of a vector respectively. As you may have been able to tell, the magnitude of a vector is just found using the Pythagorean theorem. There can be many ways to write the components of a vector but in this notebook we will use the notation $\\vec{v} = (v_x,v_y)$ for vectors that begin at the origin. For the red vector shown above we get that \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{v} = (2,6)$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the magnitude is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lvert\\lvert\\vec{v}\\rvert\\rvert = \\sqrt{2^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{40} \\approx 6.3$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next it is important to understand how to interpret the direction of a vector. This is of course, merely the direction that the arrow points in our diagram but it should be known that this direction comes from the $x$ and $y$ components that make up the vector. In this case this is $(v_x,v_y)$ where $v_x$ is in the $\\hat{x}$ direction and $v_y$ is in the $\\hat{y}$ direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back to Newton's Second Law\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we are familiar with vectors let's look at how Newton's Second law impacts the motion of objects."
