    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout most of history, humans did not understand light as we do today. As science and technology have progressed over time, so too has our knowledge of the nature of light. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, when we say the word \"light\", we will be referring to visible light (light that comes from the sun, lightbulbs etc.). We will go over how a few key experiments kickstarted a new way of thinking, and a few of the ways that we are able to manipulate light. We will also talk about how our eyes enable us to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had to describe to someone what light is, you may have a hard time. Some people think of light as the absence of darkness, but even that doesn't say much about light itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our understanding of light truly began around the 17th century, when a few individuals started to realize that light was not a mystical substance. Scientists (or \"natural philosophers\", as they were called during that time) recognized that certain properties of light were measurable, and that some properties could be manipulated. Sir Isaac Newton and Ole Rømer were among the first scientists to take a step in this direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Isaac Newton's Prism Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Sir Isaac Newton has made contributions to many fields of science and mathematics. In 1666, while spending time at his childhood home in Lincolnshire, England, Newton began experimenting with light. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a small slit in his window shutters, Newton passed a narrow beam of sunlight through a glass prism. The light travelled through the prism, and projected a rainbow of color on the other side!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://lightingmatters.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/White-Light-Prism-Experiment.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",

    "<center> Figure 2: This picture shows how a prism can create a spectrum of color. This is what Newton would have seen in 1666.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, scientists determined that the prism was actually splitting light into its component parts. This phenomenon is called **dispersion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this experiment, Newton demonstrated that white light was actually made up of all the individual colors of the rainbow!\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Ole Rømer and the Speed of Light\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years, people thought that if somebody lit a match, the light from that match would be instantly visible to everyone, no matter how far away they were. However, in 1676 Ole Rømer proved that this is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rømer spent a long time studying the orbit of Io, one of Jupiter's moons. As part of his study, he began predicting the times when Io should be hidden behind Jupiter's shadow (these periods are called eclipses). However, Rømer saw that his predictions for when these eclipses should occur were not always accurate. "

Rømer thought that when the distance between Io and the Earth increased, it might take a longer time for light coming from Io to reach Earth. If this were the case, then the light must be travelling at a finite speed!\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking many measurements and using some clever mathematics, Rømer calculated the speed of light to be roughly 220,000,000 m/s, or 792,000,000 km/h.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we have measured the speed of light to be 299,792,458 m/s. Although he was not exactly right, Rømer provided one of the first mathematical calculations for the speed of light. \n",

    "Mirages also occur because of refraction, but they do not result in a display of color like a rainbow. This type of refraction occurs due to a difference in temperature between separate layers of air.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we were describing before, refraction occurs when light travels from one substance to another. Well, it turns out that hot air and cold air are actually different enough to act as different substances. Therefore, light will refract when passing through one to the other. \n",

This appearance occurs when layers of hot and cold air are mixing together, and light passing through these layers is constantly being refracted in different directions.\n",
