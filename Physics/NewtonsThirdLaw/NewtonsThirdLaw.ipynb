The person on the left is big, heavy, and moving quickly with his feet planting firmly on the ground. He will firmly absorb any force, and only slow down a bit. \n",

    "The person on the right is small, light-weight, not moving initially, and lifts her feet off the floor. When the equal-sized force hits her, she flies back quickly because her momentum, and her velocity must make a big change in reaction to the force of the collision.\n",

    "By the Second Law, a force causes a change in momentum (velocity times mass), so it is the change in **momentum** that must be equal. Here, the smaller person on the right, with lower mass, has to see a bigger change in velocity in the collision to have an equivalent change of momentum. So this person bounces back much faster.\n",

    "\n",
    "By the Third Law, the wheels/train push back on the rails. This is the equal, opposite force. Because it is a fast, heavy train, this results in a very strong force pushing on the rails.\n",

    "Normally, the rails do not move (much) because they are cemented into the ground. In this derailment video, though, the force is so strong that the rails break! Once they are broken, there is nothing to push against the train. With no force, Newton's First Law says the train will have to move in a straight line.

    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta \\vec{p}_1 = - \\Delta \\vec{p}_2, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where delta $\\Delta$ means the ''change in'' the momentum $\\vec{p}$. \n",
    "So $\\Delta \\vec{p} = \\vec{p}(\\mbox{after}) - \\vec{p}(\\mbox{before}).$\n",
    "\n",
    "The letter $\\vec{p}$ stands for momentum (*petere* in Latin), and is just the product of mass times velocity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rewriting momentum as mass times velocity,  for the two balls (1 and 2) we have\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\left( m_1 \\cdot \\vec{v}_1 \\right) = - \\Delta \\left( m_2 \\cdot \\vec{v}_2\\right).$$\n",
    "The minus sign on the right is to remind us that the change is in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the balls in this simulation, the masses stay constant, and it is only the velocities that change, so we can write\n",
    "$$ m_1 \\cdot (\\Delta \\vec{v}_1) = - m_2 \\cdot (\\Delta  \\vec{v}_2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the relative change in velocities is related to the ratio of their masses,\n",

    "Well, if we ignore the forces of their feet on the floor, we see the boy's change in velocity is 5 m/s. Since the ratio of masses $m_2/m_1$ is 2, the change in the girl's velocity must be twice as great. So she goes from 0 m/s to 10 m/s (which is very fast).\n",

    "- The girl goes from zero to $40\\times 10$ = $+400$ kg m/s.\n",

    "In fact, the forces can be quite complicated. With the boy and girl colliding, the force is transmitted through the bouncy ball. So it is a small force, extended over a rather long time (a few tenths of a second). If they were holding hard steel balls, the force of collision would have been very large, over a short time (a hundreth of a second, say). Fortunately, we don't need to know these details to use the Third Law."
