    "English Translation: **The rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction.**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vec{F}$ is the force, $m$ is the mass of the body which experiences the force and $\\vec{a}$ is the acceleration of that same body. This allows us to carefully analyze the motion of an object once it has been impacted by the force. An important aspect of understanding this motion is to be familiar with vectors and their notation, so before we get more in depth with Newton's $2^{\\rm nd}$ Law let's look at what vectors are!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors and Their Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard definiton for a vector says that they represent both the magnitude and direction of some physical quanity. These quantities can include forces, velocity, acceleration and electromagnetic fields, just to name a few. Vectors (we will use an arbitrary variable $v$) are often denoted as $\\vec{v}$ or as $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Both styles are valid choices when typing on a computer but of course by hand it is most acceptable to write vectors with the arrow notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now, what does a vector actually look like? Well when looking at the cartesian coordinate system (Euclidean space) we get the usual coordinate axis that looks something like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/Cartesian_axes.png\" height='450px' width = '450px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Within these coordinates it is then very easy to generate a vector that has both *magnitude* and *direction*. Check it out!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/Vector_2.png\" height = '450px' width = '450px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the magnitude of this vector it only takes simple trigonometry (only in cartesian coordinates for 2D space). We define the magnitude as \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lvert\\lvert\\vec{v}\\rvert\\rvert = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of a vector respectively. As you may have been able to tell, the magnitude of a vector is just found using the Pythagorean theorem. There can be many ways to write the components of a vector but in this notebook we will use the notation $\\vec{v} = (v_x,v_y)$ for vectors that begin at the origin. For the red vector shown above we get that \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{v} = (2,6)$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the magnitude is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lvert\\lvert\\vec{v}\\rvert\\rvert = \\sqrt{2^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{40} \\approx 6.3$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next it is important to understand how to interpret the direction of a vector. This is of course, merely the direction that the arrow points in our diagram but it should be known that this direction comes from the $x$ and $y$ components that make up the vector. In this case this is $(v_x,v_y)$ where $v_x$ is in the $x$ direction and $v_y$ is in the $y$ direction so the net force is pointed in both the $x$ and $y$ directions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back to Newton's Second Law\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we are familiar with vectors let's look at how Newton's Second law impacts the motion of objects. Again, Newton's Second Law is written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where now we know that the *net* force $\\vec{F}$ and the accleration $\\vec{a}$ are vectors. So of course this tells us that the acceleration is in the **same** direction as the net force. To get the full picture of how this law can describe the motion of an object we'll look at the components of the law in 2 separate parts, starting with net force, then onto accleration and mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Net Force\n",
    "\n",
    "A force is merely defined in Physics as something that changes the motion of an object. You'll often hear it defined as a \"push\" or a \"pull\", which works in the context of 2D problems but doesn't give as clear of a description in 3D so this notebook will refrain from using that nomenclature. There are many types of forces that we experience and interact with every day. Some of these include applied forces, electric and magnetic forces, gravity, friction, etc. If there are 2 or more of these forces acting on a body, we get a **net** force in the resulting direction. To understand how a net force is quantified here is an image showing the resultant, net force from two individual forces. "

For example let's simplify our original case and only induce a force of gravity on several objects of varying mass (**where no air resistance is present, i.e. space**)."

It was stated earlier that $g$ was defined to be $9.81$ $\\rm m/s^2$, but this is only the case for when we are situated on the surface of the Earth. Our Earth itself experiences a gravitational force, influenced by our Sun, and this is what causes ours and all the other planets to orbit around it.

How might this work for an orbiting planet ? And why doesn't a planet just fall into the Sun, just like how we are brought back to the ground ?

Due to conservation of angular momentum and energy, the orbital velocity that this material had while the star was forming, remains long after the star and planets have formed.

To start off, try equating $F=ma$ to $F=\\frac{\\large kq_1q_2}{\\large r^2}$ and then solve for the acceleration and see how it behaves with respect to the mass. \n",

    "Great, you've reached the end of your journey through Newton's Second Law! It's important to remember the major aspects of what we covered throughout this notebook. Newton's Second Law is crucial in explaining how an object behaves once a force has been applied. We know that it's acceleration is directly proportional to the force itself. As well it should be clear that the acceleration is **ALWAYS** in the same direction as the net force on the object. How the mass of the object effects the accleration is completely dependent on the analytical form of the force as we saw throughout through examples such as the falling balls hitting the water. Hopefully you're now more comfortable with all these ideas and they can be translated into understanding more about physics !"
