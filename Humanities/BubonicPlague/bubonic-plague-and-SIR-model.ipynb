    "\n",
    "In this model, the total population is divided into three groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Susceptible: individuals that can become infected but haven't been yet\n",
    "* Infected: individuals that are infected\n",
    "* Removed: individuals that are either dead or recovered \n",
    "\n",
    "We are looking at the changes, over the course of an outbreak, of the numbers of these individuals, represented by $S$, $I$, and $R$. In other words we want to understand how, as time passes, the number of individuals in each group changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having a realistic model might be useful for predicting the long-term outcome of an outbreak and informing public health interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can predict that the number of removed people will stay low and the number of infected people will quickly go down to zero, then there is no need to intervene and we can let the outbreak end by itself while only providing medical attention to the infected people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely if we predict a large increase of the numbers of infected and removed individuals, then the outbreak needs a quick intervention before it results in a large number of casualties. In a plague outbreak this intervention would, for example, be to make sure there is no contact between infected and susceptible people.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now describe the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Removed) mathematical model of an outbreak over time (for example every week). We write $S_t, I_t, R_t$ to denote the number of susceptible, infected, and removed individuals at time point $t$. $t=1$ is the first recorded time point, $t=2$ is the second and so on. We call *time unit* the time elapsed between two time points, for example a day or a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, we assume that the **total population is constant** (so births and deaths are ignored) for the duration of the model simulation. We represent the total population size by $N$, and so at any time point $t$ we have $$N=S_t + I_t + R_t$$"

    "We assume that transmission requires contact between an infected individual and a susceptible individual. We also assume that the disease takes a constant amount of time to progress within an infected individual until they are removed (die or recover). We need to define these two processes (infection and removal) and model how they impact the transition from the time $t = (S_t,I_t,R_t)$ to the next state $t + 1 = (S_{t+1},I_{t+1},R_{t+1})$.\n",

We discuss this term later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The occurrence of removals of infected people is modeled using a parameter denoted by $\\gamma$. It is defined to be proportion of infected individuals that die or recover between two time points. If we are given that the duration of an infection is $T$ (i.e. how many time points it takes for an individual between infection and removal), then $\\gamma = \\dfrac{1}{T}$. \n",

    "##### Technical remarks.\n",
    "First, note that the SIR model does not enforce that the values $S_t,I_t,R_t$ at a given time point are integers. As $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are actually floating numbers, these values are actually most of the time not integers. This is fine as the SIR model is an approximate model and aims mostly at predicting the general dynamics of an outbreak, not the precise values for the number of susceptible, infected, and removed individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, one can ask how to find the values of the parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ that are necessary to have a full SIR model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, the parameter $\\gamma$ is relatively easy to find from knowing how the disease progress in a patient, as it is mostly the inverse of the average time a patient is sick. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\beta$ is less easy to obtain. Reading the equations we can see that during a time point, out of the $S_t$ susceptible individuals, the number that get infected is $(\\dfrac{{\\beta}}{N}) S_t I_t$. As mentioned above, the product $S_t I_t$ can be interpreted as the set of all possible contacts between the $S_t$ susceptible individuals and the $I_t$ infected individuals and is often a large number, much larger than $S_t$ and in the order of $N^2$. The division by $N$ aims to lower this number, mostly to normalize it by the total population, to make sure it is in order of $N$ and not quadratic in $N$. So in order for the number of newly infected individuals during a time unit to be reasonable, $\\beta$ is generally a  small number between $0$ and $1$. But formally, if we pick a value for $\\beta$ that is too large, then the SIR model will predict value for $S_t$ that can be negative, which is inconsistent with the modeled phenomenon. So choosing the value of $\\beta$ is the crucial step in modelling an outbreak."

This epidemic did not kill as many people as the Black Death (1347 - 1351), however it is remembered as the \"Great Plague of London\" as it was the last widespread outbreak that affected England. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"City records indicate that some 68,596 people died during the epidemic, though the actual number of deaths is suspected to have exceeded 100,000 out of a total population estimated at 460,000. \" [Great Plague of London\"; Encyclopædia Britannica; Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.; September 08, 2016](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Plague-of-London)\n",

    "When the bubonic plague outbreak hit London, people started to leave the city and go to the countryside, hoping to avoid the disease. But as can be expected, some of these people were already infected when they left London, and so carried the disease to start other outbreaks in some nearby villages. This happened in the village of Eyam.\n",

So nobody was allowed to enter or leave the village and people stayed there hoping the outbreak would end by itself without too many casualties; note that from a mathematical point of view, that implies that the assumption that the sum of the numbers of susceptible, infected and removed individuals, the population, is constant.\n",

Obviously these data are imperfect (some people did not declare they were sick by fear of being ostracized, some people died too fast for the plague to be diagnosed, etc.), but nevertheless, they provide us with interesting data to see if the SIR model is an appropriate model for such a plague outbreak. \n",

    "From questions 1 and 2 above we know the values of $N$ and $\\gamma$ (check your answers at the bottom of this notebook). From the data table we also know $S_1,I_1,R_1$, the state of the population at the start of the outbreak. So if we want to apply the SIR model we need to find  a value for $\\beta$ the parameter, the number susceptible people becoming infected during a time unit. We consider here that a time unit is 1 day; the Eyam outbreak spanned 112 days, so 112 time units, even if data were only recorded every 2 weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A standard scientific approach for the problem of finding $\\beta$ is to try various values and see if there is one that leads to predicted values for $S_n,I_n,R_n$ that match the observed data. In order to evaluate this match, we focus on the number of infected people, the most important element of an outbreak.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below allows you to do this: you can choose a value of $\\beta$, click on the \"Run interact\" button and it will show on the same graph a set of 8 blue dots (the observed number of infected people from the data table) and a set of 112 red dots, corresponding to the predicted number of infected individuals for the chosen value of $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are several mathematical ways to define what would be the *best fit*, here we are not getting into this and you are just asked to try to find a value of $\\beta$ that generated blue dots being approximately on the graph defined by the red dots. Pay particular attention to the first four blue dots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this case $0 < \\beta < 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Warning:\n",
    "The SIR model is a very simple approximation of the dynamics of a true outbreak, so don't expect to find a value of $\\beta$ that generates a graph that contains exactly all observed data points (blue dots).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular note that the data from September 3 and 19 seem to be somewhat of an anomaly as we observe a sharp decrease in the number of infected followed by a surge. This could be due to many reasons, for example poor statistics recording (we are considering a group of people under heavy stress likely more motivated by trying to stay alive than to record accurate vital statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "So here we are interested in finding a parameter $\\beta$ that captures the general dynamics (increase followed by a post-peak decrease) of the outbreak. You can expect to find a reasonable value for $\\beta$ but be aware that many values, especially too high, will result in a very poor match between observed data and model predictions."
